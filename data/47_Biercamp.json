                "description": "Sunny Day Satisfaction at Biercamp\n\nOn a bright sunny day, I ventured to Biercamp in Ann Arbor for a delightful lunch takeout experience that still leaves my taste buds reminiscing. Known for their commitment to handmade, locally sourced foods, Biercamp offers a rustic charm that is hard to find elsewhere.\n\nMost Enjoyed Dish: The 12HR Smoked Brisket sandwich was the star of the meal.\nServed on a soft, buttery brioche bun, the brisket was incredibly juicy, tender, and packed with flavor, complemented beautifully by the tanginess of pickles and onions, and a delicious BBQ sauce that tied everything together perfectly.\n\nAlso Tried:\n\n-Cheddar Hot Dogs: Freshly made in-house and smoked on site, these hot dogs were a treat. Served on a toasted bun, they were a simple pleasure that brought out the child in me.\n-Chicken Bratwurst: Also made in-house and served on a toasted bun, the bratwurst was succulent and seasoned to perfection, making for a satisfying bite.\n\nLoved Their Self-Served Topping Bar:\nA highlight was their self-served topping bar, which featured a variety of condiments including yellow mustard, dijon, backwoods sweet jalapeno mustard, ketchup, BBQ sauce, onions, sauerkraut, dill relish, and sweet relish. This allowed for a personalized touch to each dish, enhancing the flavors according to my preference.\n\nOther Thoughts:\nI'm particularly intrigued by their nitro cold brew, which I plan to try on my next visit. The concept of combining a craft brewery atmosphere with exceptional food quality makes Biercamp a standout.\n\nFinal Impressions:\nBiercamp is more than just a barbecue spot; it's a testament to the art of in-house meat preparation and smoking, complemented by an impressive selection of craft beers.\nWhether you\u2019re dining in their all-season outdoor beer garden or grabbing a quick takeout, their dedication to quality and flavor is evident.\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a genuine, flavorful meal in a casual, friendly setting.",

For us this is a piece of our old home, Texas \ud83d\ude0a We've bought sausage and chorizo and also extremely yummy. I can't wait for the day that I try more of their menu but it's tough not to get their brisket. We saw pastrami and Reuben sandwiches on their menu. I'm already looking forward to my next visit \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b BTW, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly.
