                "description": "Sunny Day Satisfaction at Biercamp\n\nOn a bright sunny day, I ventured to Biercamp in Ann Arbor for a delightful lunch takeout experience that still leaves my taste buds reminiscing. Known for their commitment to handmade, locally sourced foods, Biercamp offers a rustic charm that is hard to find elsewhere.\n\nMost Enjoyed Dish: The 12HR Smoked Brisket sandwich was the star of the meal.\nServed on a soft, buttery brioche bun, the brisket was incredibly juicy, tender, and packed with flavor, complemented beautifully by the tanginess of pickles and onions, and a delicious BBQ sauce that tied everything together perfectly.\n\nAlso Tried:\n\n-Cheddar Hot Dogs: Freshly made in-house and smoked on site, these hot dogs were a treat. Served on a toasted bun, they were a simple pleasure that brought out the child in me.\n-Chicken Bratwurst: Also made in-house and served on a toasted bun, the bratwurst was succulent and seasoned to perfection, making for a satisfying bite.\n\nLoved Their Self-Served Topping Bar:\nA highlight was their self-served topping bar, which featured a variety of condiments including yellow mustard, dijon, backwoods sweet jalapeno mustard, ketchup, BBQ sauce, onions, sauerkraut, dill relish, and sweet relish. This allowed for a personalized touch to each dish, enhancing the flavors according to my preference.\n\nOther Thoughts:\nI'm particularly intrigued by their nitro cold brew, which I plan to try on my next visit. The concept of combining a craft brewery atmosphere with exceptional food quality makes Biercamp a standout.\n\nFinal Impressions:\nBiercamp is more than just a barbecue spot; it's a testament to the art of in-house meat preparation and smoking, complemented by an impressive selection of craft beers.\nWhether you’re dining in their all-season outdoor beer garden or grabbing a quick takeout, their dedication to quality and flavor is evident.\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a genuine, flavorful meal in a casual, friendly setting.",

                "description": "I am from Texas and this is my favorite place to get brisket. They do it right with a delicious sauce and pickles and onions 🤤 My mom really enjoys their pulled pork sandwiches. For us this is a piece of our old home, Texas 😊 We've bought sausage and chorizo and also extremely yummy. I can't wait for the day that I try more of their menu but it's tough not to get their brisket. We saw pastrami and Reuben sandwiches on their menu. I'm already looking forward to my next visit 😋😋😋 BTW, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Also the extra seating next door is another great addition 👍🏼",
