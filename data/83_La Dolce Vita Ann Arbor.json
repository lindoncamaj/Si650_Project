I like to make fancy deserts at home and it was awesome to see different mousses and a ganache come together with a fudgey brownie. The textures were varied from fluffy to dense - and I loved it! I wish there was a more substantial fruit pairing (I think they used to serve this desert with a blackberry sorbet, but now it is just a berry coulis) because the flavors mixed so well. The atmosphere and the seating are also part of the experience. I came early and had my choice of couch, which had a nice view of the fireplace. The only thing that took away from the atmosphere was the manager was talking down to the wait staff right beside me for some time during my visit.",
