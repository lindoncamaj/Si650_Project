I do agree that this is a 5-star experience, however, beware that it is super pricey and you may not make any adjustments. So, know what you are getting into ahead of time. Reservations are necessary and fill up extremely quickly, as there are not very many tables. Most of the dishes were delicious. We had the vegetarian menu designed for the month. The gnocchi and dessert were top notch. The hard beets, meh, but everyone has different tastes. It was quite enjoyable and the service was great.",

The menu was prefix and $75 a person, with immaculate service and generous portions.

                "description": "The best fine dining restaurant in Ann Arbor. The ingredients are super fresh and the flavors are nothing like what I’ve had before. Went there both in the fall and in the winter. I would say because they only use in season ingredients, there are probably more fresh vegetables and fruits in warmer seasons. Winter menu had lots of root vegetables. They change the menu every month so it’s worth going back too. The experience is not like typical fine dining because you sit right next to other customers. Food is served in a sharing style. It’s more like eating a nice dinner at someone’s house.",

I love how they give you specific wine pairings to go with the menu, anywhere from reds all the way to sparkling. I can’t stop dreaming about the pistachio dark chocolate cake we had. By far the best thing I have ever tasted. We enjoyed the cozy vibe.  Be prepared for communal seating and sitting at a table most likely right next to other people. But everyone was super nice and we even had opportunities to chat with those next to us which made the whole experience a fun communal setting, yet super intimate at the same time. Service was remarkable. We are planning to make this a monthly thing to go and try the menu every month. It felt truly like we were in NYC or Chicago, not A2 ( in the best way)!",

                "description": "I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the best meal you’ll eat in Ann Arbor. Indeed it would not be an exaggeration to say you’d have a hard time finding a better place in New York or London - and I’ve tried. Abby’s cooking is always superb, always in season, always surprising and comforting at the same time. If she makes it, I will eat it, even if it’s something I’d normally hate. Yes it’s not cheap, but unlike a dozen other places in town where you’ll pay the same, you’ll leave feeling like you should have paid more. I’ve included pictures of the October menu and once again I can’t believe how I always think it can’t possibly be better than last month, but after years of coming for every menu, every month, I’m still charmed every time. This food is special. You’re not getting this somewhere else.\n\nI should also add that I’m not much of a wine drinker, but what I know about wine I owe to Steve, who makes choosing wine a delight. First, he provides a curated list with each menu, both by the glass and the bottle, and you can be sure whatever you choose it will pair beautifully with what you’re eating. But even better, he and the staff make wine fun and easy rather than intimidating. I’ve learned so much because I felt confident to try things; I know I won’t be steered wrong and I know I’m not being judged. We’ve even gone to the special wine tasting evenings and started buying wine to take back home.\n\nThe atmosphere here is also amazing, which honestly doesn’t feel fair to other restaurants since the food and drink are already so superb. Every member of the staff is pleasant, friendly, and helpful. I haven’t felt like a local at many places in my life, but I’m truly always happy to see how everyone is at Spencer’s. That’s not just because we’ve come for years, it was that way from almost the first time we came. I love supporting this restaurant, not just because I love dining here, but becayse I care about the people, I want them to do well, and my life is richer because this wonderful place is part of my community.",

                "description": "I usually don’t leave 5stars. Most excellent places are 4, but this place is exceptional. Went there about 1.5 months ago during labors day weekend with my boyfriend and his mom. Was so excited to try for a long time and it did not disappoint me! The presentation is fantastic, the talk they give for you is nice. The food, is of course so good. If you do $75 dinner option the portion is pretty huge, but it could depend on the time and menu, I guess? This is probably the only fine dining restaurant I can recommend to anyone who’d like to have a full experience and amazing dishes for special occasions. - and don’t forget grab some wines their selections are quite interesting even I don’t know much about wines could see how unique each wine is. Excited to visit them again for fall/winter menu!!",

Very impressed with the wine selection and diversity of regions. Overall, a well rounded experience and can’t wait to try next month’s menu.\n\nPerhaps one recommendation would be to extend the dining time from 90 to 120 minutes.",
