                "description": "Oct 2024\nFood 4/5 stars\nThanks to  TMobile Tuesday promo, I finally got to try Shake Shack. Ordered the Shack burger $7, chicken bites $6, and a Peaches and cream milkshake $7.\n\nThe burger is small, enough for those with a small appetite or if you're looking for a quick snack. Tasted alright but not enough sauce; just a dab of Shack sauce with 2 slices of tomato, few tiny pieces of lettuce, added onions and pickles. Condiments were proportionate to the size of cheeseburger.\n\nThe chicken bites were actually nice with a crisp outer coating. I wouldn't pair this with the Shack sauce again, too bland. However, $6 approx with tax is a bit pricey for the portion. Bites are tiny.\n\nThe best of the meal was the peaches and cream shake with tiny chunks of peaches in the shake. Creamy and full of flavor.\n\nCustomer service 5/5 stars\nStaff on duty today were super nice at the front counter, especially this young guy. Attentive to customers.\n\nThis location is very spacious and well lit with lots of windows and plenty of seating.",

                "description": "I have to say, it's hard to unimpress me with a burger unless you're McDonald's, but after all the hype I've gotta give it a big fat 2 thumbs down.\nMy wife had the shack stack. I had a Caraliona burger and a shack burger. My Carolina burger was dry. There was zero sauce of any sort and being raised in the south that's not Carolina anything. The pictures are also misleading as the burgers are very small. My Carolina burger was 10.00 ala carte.\nMy shack burger was also tiny with 2 pieces of limp lettuce usually what gets discarded, 2 slices Roma tomatoes, and a tiny smudge of shack sauce which I tasted by itself before I wiped it off my bun and put ketchup and mustard on which made it better. That was a 7.00 burger no cheese ala carte.\nIn all for 3 burgers, 2 fries, and a shake the total was 46.00 and not delivery but pick up. I'm not a picky eater. I've been a chef and restaurant manager for 18 years and I definitely won't eat there again. 46.00 for 2 people and not even full. There was about 2.00 worth of ingredients in the burgers and I'm not exaggerating that's a literal statement. The fries were cold we were only 5 minutes away from the hotel. They were honestly like the old long John silvers fries. Nothing worth 46.00 dollars about it.",

                "description": "Visited Starbucks in Ann Arbor and tried their new Korean-inspired cuisine \u2013 the Korean Chicken Burger and Bulgogi Burger. Both were awesome, though I wished the spicy chicken sauce was a bit spicier with a touch more sweetness. The Bulgogi Burger resembled the original Shake Shack burger. Overall, a great experience exploring new flavors!",

                "description": "Today I visited Shake shack on its grand opening. The new Ann Arbor store is 3rd one in Michigan. They have everything offered at the other locations \u2014 classic burgers, hot dogs, crinkle cut fries, shakes and fresh-made frozen custard. The space is lovely with high ceilings with exposed metal beams. Lots of glass windows let in light. And all of the furniture is very environmentally friendly... I understand the tables are from reclaimed bowling alley lanes (I captured that in my pics) The burgers are juicy and seasoned well. We ordered a couple of the double smoke shacks and a couple orders of crinkle-cut fries. Adding in a shake and a large soda got us to 35 bucks with tax. So yeah it\u2019s a bit pricey. The quality is great though. I only wish the crinkle cut fries were hotter in temperature. I think they were making huge batches of fries and keeping them warm to handle this evening\u2019s huge crowds, so I will definitely be back to give them another try. I will also order booze next time. Check it out. It\u2019s worth the trip. Feel free to like if you found this helpful.",
