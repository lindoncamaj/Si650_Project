We usually pass right by it on our way to the Olive Garden in that same plaza.\n\nWe finally went in one day and was met with the most hospitable,  manager, Megan, and our waiter, Jacob! Not only was the food presented elegantly, but our dishes were very delicious. I had the salmon on the menu, and my husband had the moist, favorable, chicken. The calamari was the best that I've had in a long time.\n\nNeedless to say, we will be back! They made us feel like famous stars visiting for the first time on top of the food being amazing.",

                "description": "I just ate here and service was great but the food was incredible. Our server Amanda described certain dishes with knowledge and I was impressed. I have the filet and I\u2019ve eaten this cut in various high end places but never finished to this level with sides and sauces that matched meat in attention to detail. There were 2 others in my group and they cleaned their plates and were all completely satisfied. I live 4 hours away but would come here for this food. I look forward to my next work trip back.",

The food was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The bacon wrapped dates were a surprisingly delicious flavor combo. We got the lamb shank and the salmon for entrees, both awesome. Dessert (rice pudding) was amazing as well. Love that its family owned. This place has been hiding from me! We will be back in the very near future.",

After over 25 years in the restaurant industry I consider myself to be an excellent (almost snobbish) judge of fine cuisine. Mediterrano not only exceeded my expectations, they raised the bar for their entire city. This was hands down the BEST meal I have ever had in Michigan. We had the salad with poached pears and gorgonzola which had the most sublime fig balsamic vinaigrette. We also had one of the nightly specials which was impeccably cooked swordfish over roasted fingerling potatoes with fennel and a pistachio beurre blanc. It was absolutely delicious!\n\nThe staff, especially Dimitri and Megan, were amazing and made us feel right at home. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and even though we sat at the bar, I noticed the tables were well spaced to allow for cozy dining even if it\u2019s busy. They have a superbly curated wine list and some marvelous cocktail and beer choices as well.\n\nThis restaurant is definitely worth the visit and I\u2019d am looking forward to my next trip!",

The food however was of poor quality.  The lamb lollipops were ok.  My kebab had so much oregano and parsley in the meat that it overpowered the dish.  And it was small.  The lamb lollipops had almost as much meat and the lamb was an app. Hummus tasted like canned chick peas blended and thrown on a plate and absolutely covered in way too much paprika.  No flavor at all.  Greek salad tasted like week old bagged iceberg lettuce.  2 apps, 2 small Greek salads, lamb lollipops (which was a small plate), and the kebab, no drinks cost 90$.  No way!  It was bad and way overpriced.  Olive garden would have been better and much cheaper.  Don\u2019t bother.",
