The gentleman there was beyond helpful and super patient with us while explaining the menu and having us try some sauces to see what we like. The staff here was super friendly and fast. He also recommended a cool little spot on campus to sit and eat.\n\nThe food was very good but be warned the portions are pretty big. We had more than enough food for 2 of us and still had left over. A bit pricey but like I said it's quite a bit of food. Wings were crunchy and the sauces were very good my favorite was the Chile Soy..",
