Our recent visit included someone having blueberry pancakes, another a breakfast sandwich on sourdough, and a third with beef bulgogi, which can be ordered as part of a stirfry with vegetables, or a sliced bulgogi option that is just slices of seasoned beef on a bed of white or brown rice and a side of kimchi.\n\nPlenty of parking on the side of the building, interior features homey decorations and an atmosphere that really brought me back to family restaurants from the last century. Start with mandoo dumplings and go from there.",

I think it\u2019s unique they serve Korean food along with the standar American diner food you would expect. We didn\u2019t order any Korean dishes, but will have to be back again to try those. My husband enjoyed the homemade biscuits and gravy. I loved my tuna melt, which was grilled to perfection with the best crispy crunch on the bread. The tuna salad was delicious and tasted homemade.

The diner is small, maybe less than 10 tables though 2 were for larger parties. High chairs are available (2). I ordered the beef ramen for \u201cbrunch\u201d. It lacked flavour, beef and noodles were chewy, wasn\u2019t very tasty. My family ordered regular breakfast and said it was good, though pricey for the amount and quality of food.\nA single toilet bathroom is located through the kitchen. Not enough space to walk through.

Friendly staff and busy on a Sunday for lunch!\n\nOct 2023\nExcellent food! All around good selection of items for breakfast, lunch and dinner. However, it's really a local hidden gem for their yummy limited Korean dishes on the menu, especially the bibimbap, spicy chicken and beef bulgogi! \ud83d\ude0b\n\nFamily business that has been in Ann Arbor a very long time.",

                "description": "I really love that it is Korean owned and there is a menu on the back that allows people to try Korean options! The food was very excellent to be honest! I got a Tofu Bibimbap bowl and all the vegetables were so fresh! The tofu was marinated and silky, just how I like it! My son got the Bulgogi with rice and cucumber kimchi, and my husband the Udon noodles.\n\nOne special thing about the diner is the fact that it has normal American breakfast options and sandwiches. I feel the prices here can\u2019t be beat! I highly recommend.",

Their house made hot sauce is quite sweet and mildly hot, I love the flavor. I've mainly stuck with the Korean dishes at the restaurant and they have always been delightful.",
