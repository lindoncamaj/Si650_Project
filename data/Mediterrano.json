We usually pass right by it on our way to the Olive Garden in that same plaza.\n\nWe finally went in one day and was met with the most hospitable,  manager, Megan, and our waiter, Jacob! Not only was the food presented elegantly, but our dishes were very delicious. I had the salmon on the menu, and my husband had the moist, favorable, chicken. The calamari was the best that I've had in a long time.\n\nNeedless to say, we will be back! They made us feel like famous stars visiting for the first time on top of the food being amazing.",

There were 2 others in my group and they cleaned their plates and were all completely satisfied. I live 4 hours away but would come here for this food. I look forward to my next work trip back.",

After over 25 years in the restaurant industry I consider myself to be an excellent (almost snobbish) judge of fine cuisine. Mediterrano not only exceeded my expectations, they raised the bar for their entire city. This was hands down the BEST meal I have ever had in Michigan. We had the salad with poached pears and gorgonzola which had the most sublime fig balsamic vinaigrette. We also had one of the nightly specials which was impeccably cooked swordfish over roasted fingerling potatoes with fennel and a pistachio beurre blanc. It was absolutely delicious!\n\nThe staff, especially Dimitri and Megan, were amazing and made us feel right at home. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and even though we sat at the bar, I noticed the tables were well spaced to allow for cozy dining even if itâ€™s busy. They have a superbly curated wine list and some marvelous cocktail and beer choices as well.\n\nThis restaurant is definitely worth the visit and Iâ€™d am looking forward to my next trip!",
