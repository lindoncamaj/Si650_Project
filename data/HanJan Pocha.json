The atmosphere was vibrant and perfect for socializing, with great vibes all around.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was definitely the pork feet. It was incredibly tender and packed with flavor! A friendly tip—if you’re not a chili pro, I recommend putting the spicy sauce on the side. It’s delicious but packs a serious punch!\n\nHanJan Pocha really nails the concept of sharing, with generous portions that bring the group together. Their menu is inspired by Korean street food, and you can tell that everything is made with the freshest ingredients, prepared daily. It’s a must-visit for anyone looking for authentic and flavorful Korean dishes in a social and laid-back setting.",

This would be a good place for taking a large group for a splurge-y dinner on a Saturday night out, but definitely not a date night spot unless you both want the same dish and aren't big into talking.\n\nIf they pivot away from 24/7 rave and offer half-sized entrees, this would become a regular rotation with us, but as it stands, there are a *lot* of other good Korean spots in town.",

I am so excited and grateful to have an awesome Korean late night hang out and food spot here. The food was quality, savory, and well-executed. The meat was melt in your mouth. Only thing I’d recommend is more banchan next time as it was embarrassing to keep asking for refills (you need a lot of garlic with jokbal.) The drinks were also delicious and presented in a fun way.",
