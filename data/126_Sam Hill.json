They have a nice outdoor space that will be perfect for summer dining.\nThe food was good, and they had a nice whiskey selection. I'm excited to try them out again when it's warmer and I can enjoy the patio.\n\nWent back for a second visit and sat outside, great outdoor space. Highly recommend the smash burger.",

The drink options were good too. Food is decent but super limited (chips and guacamole, pretzels, chicken steak tacos, hot dogs and chicken fingers and soft serve ice cream)â€¦so if that could be expanded even a bit, this place would be ðŸ”¥ also- another suggestion to chef, please pare down the salt on all your chips!!

                "description": "My girlfriends and I went here for brunch. I had looked at the menu beforehand and there was only a handful of things I would eat, since Iâ€™m picky. Most stuff had feta or stuff I didnâ€™t want in it. I stuck with the grilled chicken sandwich and let me tell you, it was not good. It was served on Texas toast, which was too buttery and the wrong shape and size completely for the chicken. The chicken breast was thin and too small for the bread and the sandwich was doused in avacado aioli and was dripping! The chips were just ok. My friend got a grilled chicken side salad, which looked good. Other friend got the breakfast plate, said it was ok, and the other one got a pasta dish (donâ€™t remember the name) and she said it was very good. The yard was cool with yard games and fun things. The deck outside had a shade cover which was nice since it was hot. The server was nice, but after we paid, she never came back to give us water or anything even though we were there for like another hour talking. I probably wonâ€™t be going back.",

We were visiting from out of town, it's always nice to find a solid go-to restaurant for future visits!",

                "description": "We celebrated my mother's birthday on Wednesday 10/2 at Sam Hill. Our party of 8 was promptly sat and given water. Our server was attentive, even wishing my mother a happy birthday. We had a wide range of dishes that everyone was very pleased with. I had the steak salad and the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly to medium rare, my gf also had a salad with steak added to it that was cooked to a perfect medium, as ordered. The greens and salad components were all very fresh and it was tossed in the appropriate amount of dressing, not too much, not to little. We'll be back soon and thank you Sam Hill for a wonderful evening. Highly recommend!",
