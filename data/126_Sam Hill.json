They have a nice outdoor space that will be perfect for summer dining.\nThe food was good, and they had a nice whiskey selection. I'm excited to try them out again when it's warmer and I can enjoy the patio.\n\nWent back for a second visit and sat outside, great outdoor space. Highly recommend the smash burger.",

                "description": "My girlfriends and I went here for brunch. I had looked at the menu beforehand and there was only a handful of things I would eat, since I\u2019m picky. Most stuff had feta or stuff I didn\u2019t want in it. I stuck with the grilled chicken sandwich and let me tell you, it was not good. It was served on Texas toast, which was too buttery and the wrong shape and size completely for the chicken. The chicken breast was thin and too small for the bread and the sandwich was doused in avacado aioli and was dripping! The chips were just ok. My friend got a grilled chicken side salad, which looked good. Other friend got the breakfast plate, said it was ok, and the other one got a pasta dish (don\u2019t remember the name) and she said it was very good. The yard was cool with yard games and fun things. The deck outside had a shade cover which was nice since it was hot. The server was nice, but after we paid, she never came back to give us water or anything even though we were there for like another hour talking. I probably won\u2019t be going back.",

We had the tomato pies (to die for), The Hot Brown (beautiful open faced sandwich), toasted ravioli, shrimp and grits with fresh big shrimp, grits were seasoned well, and the Creekside Cobb which was so good with the goat cheese. We would definitely come back for the food and the sit at the bar for cocktails. The bar is nice!",

Our server was attentive, even wishing my mother a happy birthday. We had a wide range of dishes that everyone was very pleased with. I had the steak salad and the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly to medium rare, my gf also had a salad with steak added to it that was cooked to a perfect medium, as ordered. The greens and salad components were all very fresh and it was tossed in the appropriate amount of dressing, not too much, not to little. We'll be back soon and thank you Sam Hill for a wonderful evening. Highly recommend!",
