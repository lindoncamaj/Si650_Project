Got a great steak sandwich, I'm from philly, so I'm a bit biased. Not the greatest steak sandwich I've ever had, to be honest, but better than many I've had back home. And better than MOST I've had elsewhere.\n\nHere's where I made the mistake, and it wasn't the steak. I am a huge fan of spicy stuff. I almost always go for whatever is hottest on the menu. I didn't go for anything crazy, standard steak w/ fixins. But I also ordered some of the suicide sauce. HOLY MOLY THAT STUFF IS HOTTTTT! Again, I love spicy food, it's rare that spicy stuff gets to me.\n\nHere's where I went right.... I ordered that sauce on the side. My first bite I treated that steak like a french dip. And I'm very glad I went that route. I just wanna say, buyer beware of that suicide sauce. It's delicious, but daaang, yo. Bravo for making such a delicious sauce with such a veeeery potent kick in the face.\n\n4* because I am biased on steak sandwiches, but again, one the better ones I've had outta Philly.\n\nI didn't eat in, so I won't comment on service or atmosphere.",
