Getting waters, getting bread... Our salads came a few minutes prior to our lunch. Server said they would be back with water, but did not come back, and also did not check to see how our meal was or if we needed anything.",

The food was delicious as was the wine, service was wonderful and we really enjoyed our cozy booth in the bar. The dark chocolate mousse was divine, and I could not get enough of the bread that came with dinner! That bread alone is worth coming here for.\n\nI also appreciate that the menu is rotationally changed, and that there is more than just salad for vegetarian options.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best restaurants in Ann Arbor. Cannot recommend it enough!",
