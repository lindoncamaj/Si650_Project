I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club on a gluten-free bun, and my husband had the Classic Cheeseburger on a gluten-free bun. The menu indicated that items marked \"GF\" could be prepared gluten-free. From what I recall, only the burgers and sandwiches had the \"GF\" designation, otherwise, I would have ordered something else. The food was good and tasty, with generous portions, though it was a bit pricier compared to other places.",

Now the dish, I ordered the chicken pecan with veggies and a loaded potato. In which, everything was tasteful, well cooked, and nicely presented. The chicken and the veggies had my type of crunch. Lastly, salute to the waiter, who was great. Good energy, humor, and she had us covered. Yeah, I cleaned the plate. \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffe",

Great food, great cocktails - and the waitress offered us free carrot cake since we were first time guests! They do say \"cash preferred\", you can save a little on the bill if you don't use a CC.",
