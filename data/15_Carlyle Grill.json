I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club on a gluten-free bun, and my husband had the Classic Cheeseburger on a gluten-free bun. The menu indicated that items marked \"GF\" could be prepared gluten-free. From what I recall, only the burgers and sandwiches had the \"GF\" designation, otherwise, I would have ordered something else. The food was good and tasty, with generous portions, though it was a bit pricier compared to other places.",
