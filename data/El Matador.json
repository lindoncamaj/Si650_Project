Department was nice and tender that my mom had but it was just missing flavor for me. The chicken that I had in the fajitas were dry along with the burritos that my son had Ordered a Margarita when it first came to me. It was weak, but was I told him my drink was weak and he gladly gave me a shot to save my drink overall the service food seasoning needs to be adjusted.",

The food that I ordered over twenty years still tastes as good as if the chef when I first came across this place when I moved into my house never left.

Don‚Äôt wait until Cinco de  Mayo each year to eat great tasting Mexican cuisine just don‚Äôt take my place in the long line of satisfied customers that become loyal patrons.
