It had a wonderful unexpected nacho cheese flavor and was served with warm chips. The bread was delicious and came with a Kalamata olive butter that was fantastic! Our meal from start to finish was superb! Entrée’s were stroganoff & the whitefish! I can’t fail to mention the awesome playlist and beautiful fireplace.

It was a nice gesture that they brought out our son’s food first but the plate was so hot. we then had to take his food off of that and put it on the bread plate because we never saw our waitress. One of our suits came out hot. The other soup came out cold like it just came out of the refrigerator. Our main course was delicious although it did take about 45 minutes to get our food, the food was brought out the waitress noticed that we needed more water. She said she would go get some water. She did not come back until the end of our meal with more water. at no point where we made aware of before our credit card was that there was 3% transaction fee charge by Wall. They must have posted. So if you wish to go to Carson’s, maybe just ask not to be sent in the Cole section. Because at no point was there any empathy or apology for how the service was going.",

                "description": "This was a wonderful experience.  Each dish was absolutely creative but also extremely flavorful. They took traditional dishes and put their own personal spin on them with ease(most places attempt to do this but it ends up being bland or a bad combination). Thoroughly impressed with every dish. We had stroganoff(amazing) whitefish (amazing again and cooked to perfection). We had spinach and artichoke dip as well as chicken tortilla soup.  Even the bread and olive butter was great.  For desert we had mint chocolate chip Oreo cheesecake (extremely flavorful) and maple creme brulee (cooked to perfection yet again).  The one thing that was still good but did not overwhelmingly stand out was the bacon Mac and cheese.  It was still very good quality Mac and cheese though.  The service was great.  The ambiance was fun , but also wholesome and definitely sets the mood ! The food pairs with the setting wonderfully and the playlist was majority old school jams !!!!(loved their playlist). It was a place where you have room to sit and breath without worrying about bumping the next table and you can make it a casual night out for attire or get fancy and neither option feels over or under done.  Just be you and have a great time and enjoy the meal ! Thanks so much for being great Carson’s! As a person who multiple times per week is out searching new areas and places to eat and particularly looking for fine dining experiences my hat is off to the affordable (but yet quite a bit better than most places that are less affordable) experience that you receive here ! Please do yourself 10 favors at once and book your next dinner reservation with Carson’s on a Monday or a Saturday night and anything in between.  Will definitely be returning soon! Maybe even tomorrow 🫠",
