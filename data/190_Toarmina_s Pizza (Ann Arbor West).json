The price was ok given the tons of toppings and I was wondering if by reducing them just a little the pizza could get more affordable and easy to eat (it was so loaded that the toppings were too much weight for the bread).\n\nStaff was super kind, polite, even giving free cookies to my kids. I didn't have any issue ordering, it was straightforward, and the waiting time was really short for ordering take out at the counter (about 10 to 15 min).",
