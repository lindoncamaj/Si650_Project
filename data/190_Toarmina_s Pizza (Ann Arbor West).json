Ten minutes out from home, I called Toarmina’s from the back seat and said, “I would like a giant pizza.” They said, “Toppings?” I said, “half pep, half cheese.” They said, “10-15 minutes.” What were we about to get??? How big is giant?? Large is 14”ish? Large < Giant? What a mystery! I thought, “Surely, Giant is a rebranding of Large?” No sir! Giant is 24”! 24”!! Could hardly get it in the car! Could hardly get it in the front door! Delicious, too!",

I’d say sauce was #1, followed by cheese, and then crust.\n\nWe bought a hand-tossed and a deep dish. Both were distinct enough that I’d probably buy both again.\n\nIt is in the expensive side.",

The price was ok given the tons of toppings and I was wondering if by reducing them just a little the pizza could get more affordable and easy to eat (it was so loaded that the toppings were too much weight for the bread).\n\nStaff was super kind, polite, even giving free cookies to my kids. I didn't have any issue ordering, it was straightforward, and the waiting time was really short for ordering take out at the counter (about 10 to 15 min).",

Even after $10 Groupon, it was still $33, which included a tip.\n\nHowever, food was decent! I'll go back to check out other items on menu and try a different 🍕 to make my way through the list.\n\nCalled in order but there was still about an additional 15-20 minute wait upon arrival. A gentleman in line ahead of me waited to order but eventually left.\n\n4 stars for the wait and pricing 😋",
