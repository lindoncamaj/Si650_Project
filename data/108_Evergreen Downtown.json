                "description": "This was my first time dining at Evergreen Downtown and I was very pleased with our choice.\n\nI have eaten at expensive Chinese restaurants in Richmond and Vancouver, Canada, but this place does well at a very reasonable cost. Good food is not cheap, and people usually expect Americanized portions and food with excess protein or filling, but here you get appropriate portions and correctly prepared food, not sacrificing quality for quantity\u2019s sake.\n\nThe atmosphere was beautiful at the early afternoon hour and the wait staff eased our unfamiliarity to the restaurant with welcoming smiles and pleasant attitude (mind you we were not the most polite as we entered being overheated and managing a hungry child, but they were nice regardless and we calmed in the peaceful atmosphere). In the  area at night I imagine it would be a beautiful place to for a date or relaxing dinner with friends.\n\nPortions were more than acceptable at a traditional Chinese establishment, and I attach a picture of our lamb to show how much was left after serving three. The flavors were fantastic, through our own fault we did not ask them to make it spicy (Due to looking like a normal American man I find that many restaurants will not make things spicy enough for my tastes, and I will ask next time for some more Sichuan peppercorn).\n\nFinally the service was appropriate and timely, and refills were provided as needed.\n\nDumplings were very wonderful textbook flavor. Could not have been better, and the meat and tofu were fresh and perfect for our tastes.\n\nPrice was fine, and tip was not required though it was deserved.\n\nThank you for a wonderful experience, and as I will be traveling to Ann Arbor with frequency this fall I am sure to return, as time and presence allow.",

The flavors are pronounced, but not too overwhelming\u2026 Simply delectable! And if you have special dietary needs they can make anything on the menu with low- or no-sodium, and spice levels can be customized as well.",

It is a clean, airy environment, with attentive waitstaff and incredibly fresh food. Once seated, we had time to browse through their electronic menu. It was nice to be able to tap menu dishes to find out what ingredients they used. I was able to order a vegetable dish without sauce (it's sad, I know, but it works for my dietary recreations). The wanton soup was amazing. My husband enjoyed a fried rice dish. And my vegetable dish was fresh and cooked well. While the dining area was quiet while we were there for an early dinner, there were numerous take out orders being picked up. Everything was organized and efficient. We would recommend.",
