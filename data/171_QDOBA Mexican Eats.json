                "description": "UPDATE: They reached out to me after I posted this review and said they would give me a refund. 3 months later, I still have yet to receive any compensation. I haven't been back since this review and I will never be returning in the future. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nHands down this has got to be to worst experience I have ever seen with a restaurant.  Things were fine until I got to the counter to place my our order.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe food:\n\nFirst off, we were wondering why the tortillas were brown but more on that later. The cilantro rice was hard and lacking cilantro. They were out of cheese. The adobo chicken I got was hard and obviously had been sitting out too long. My wife's steak was also hard and bland. My daughter couldn't even eat her nachos. We got an extra bag of chips with the meal and when we tried to eat them were greeted with a glorious pallet watering mix of stale chips, soggy chips and some way over salted chips. Know we know why she couldn't eat her nachos.\n\nThe service:\n\nThe staff was all quite rude. They gave the impression that they were done with their shift and were mad they had to work. I'm assuming the manager wasn't on duty because it did look like there were 3 servers and a cook so I'm guessing they were understaffed. When we got to the register, I asked if the chips were warm and was given an attitude. When we asked why the tortillas were brown he said that they were wheat and they were out of flour ones. Something the first server neglected to tell us.\n\nThe atmosphere:\n\nThe walkway to the counter was clear but it was quite apparent they had not cleaned their work area at all. We were there well after the dinner rush and it was clear the person responsible for cleaning up the place was not schedule to work that night. There was food caked to the counter by the register. Finally, the garbage can was well beyond full. I didn't look at the other cans but a picture says a thousand words. Judge for yourself.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWe have been patrons of this qudoba for as long as they have been open in this shopping center. I have never been so disgusted as I was tonight with this establishment. When you buy food for the whole family and the bill come out to almost 50 bucks you expect better than this.  Thankfully they opened another Qdoba on the west side of ann arbor. We will NEVER be back to this location again. I suggest that the company does a surprise inspection to see what kinda of image this store is portraying before the health department does. This store would get closed down immediately.\n\nI recommend that if you are in the mood for Qdoba to skip this place entirely and head over to zeeb road in front of Meijer. The extra time and gas spent to get there are a small price to pay to avoid this food poisoning establishment.",

However, this time I went to the Main Street location, and it was a very different experience. The staff and the building were not up to the cleanliness standards expected for serving quality food. Two men had long hair with no covering, hanging directly over the food, and the food line was a mess.
