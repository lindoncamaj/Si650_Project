                "description": "Great food, great atmosphere and great staff. This once was another place that my wife and I had our first date back in 2016. So we stopped by since we were in town together and checked the new place put and it did not disappoint\nWe sat in the same area we did back then on the half wall and looked around at the decor and it was beautiful (see pics). Sara was our server and she was absolutely wonderful and would highly suggest having her as a server. I'm sure the others are great too, but we had Sara and she was top notch. The food was delicious as I had the fajita bowl and my wife had the roman dish that's in the appetizer portion (can't remember full name of it). I tried a bit of it and it was out of this world.\n\nThis weekend is the Art Fair in A2 and I suggest stopping here for lunch or dinner. They have something going on every weekend and pretty much every night. They have a country night on Thursday and Latino dance night on Friday or Saturday (can't remember which day it is). All the more reason for you to stop by and check for yourself.",

                "description": "We love Chapala in downtown Ann Arbor. Our party came in early on a Saturday afternoon, just ahead of dinner rush (which we highly recommend) and by the time we left there was a line out the door! Which does not surprise me, the staff is friendly and inviting, fun atmosphere making you forget you’re in Michigan and feel like you’re drinking margaritas on the sunny shores of Mexico. The chips were warm and fresh, the salsa has the right amount of spice, guacamole is fresh and delicious. On this visit I enjoyed the Steak Quesadilla for the first time (very tasty!) and our entire party was pleased with their meals as well. Last but certainly not least the margaritas are great. If you’re looking for a Mexican dining experience, Chapala stands out above most others. I can’t wait to come back!",

                "description": "The food here is awesome and the vibe is great. Unfortunately our server charged us for two drinks we didn’t, technically, ask for. After I inquired about whether or not it was happy hour, the server assuring it was still, I ordered two margaritas. He asked if I wanted them frozen or on the rocks, I provided my answer, and eventually received my two drinks. Peculiar of how large they were, but excited, I drank my margarita. When I asked for the bill, which I assured I did before the END of happy hour, I noticed that the drinks on my bill seemed full price. A happy hour margarita is $6 on their menu but I was charged $16 for each one I ordered. When I checked on why our server said it must have been because I asked for my bill after the happy hour time (the bill stated otherwise). Then our server suggested that he gave us the larger size as if I asked for it, which the very thought of was invalidated due to my assuring it was still happy hour upon our arrival. They did end up taking the amount of one of the drinks off of our bill, but I didn’t enjoy having to bring up the difference in charges to begin with. If you decide to dine with Chapala in the future and you’re ordering a lunch special or happy hour margarita, ensure that you specify the price and title of what you’re ordering.",
