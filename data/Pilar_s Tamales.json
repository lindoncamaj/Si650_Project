They were not made fresh, they were the ones that you can get in the frozen food section.\n\nI remember getting these pupusas at the grocery store and thought they were a very poor excuse for pupusas but were a quick snack on par with microwave pizza rolls. The ones they have at this restaurant are worse than that. Absolutely terrible.\n\nIf I could give negative stars I could, it's bad.\n\nI don't normally leave reviews for bad restaurants, but I just had to this time. The audacity to charge as much as they do for these pupusas is crazy. It's highway robbery. You can get the real thing for much cheaper elsewhere. I got 2 \"pupusas\", plantains, and a horchata for almost $30.\n\nHow can the worst pupusas I've ever had also be the most expensive? it blows my mind.\n\nThe plantains were good though",

It was like going home. The food was fresh and delightful, there are vegan options as well. In addition to food that feeds your soul you will also find jewelry, pottery, place mats, and other beautifully made items for your home. The woman helping us was warm, kind, and thoughtful.
