Someone else brought our food out, and she did not come back to check how the food was or if we needed anything else. We had finished our food and were sitting waiting for her to come back for 30 minutes before giving up and heading inside to ask for the bill. The host told us he would find her for us and it took another 15 minutes after that for her to bring the bill out. 10 minutes later she still hadn't come back for it and it had started raining so we went inside to have them take the bill so we could leave. We got there around 9:30, were finished eating about 45 minutes later, and weren't able to leave until 11:15. I don't know if our waitress was just having an off day or if something was wrong but it was really disappointing.",

We enjoyed the Mushroom Burger, the Roasted Veggie Bowl (with Tofu), the blueberry pancakes from the kids menu, the mushroom gravy, and the potato cakes.\n\nThe Avocado toast plated well but wasn't as tasty (the avocado was bland and the toast had the overpowering bitter taste of olive oil) but everything else was top notch. Would highly recommend going to Avalon. Also, the staff was super polite and great hosts :)",
