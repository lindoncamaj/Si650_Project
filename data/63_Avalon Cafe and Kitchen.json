I find that amazing in this day and time.\nThe menu is extremely diverse. They are a breakfast, brunch, lunch restaurant only their menu covers all three!\nYou can get anything from avocado toast, to oatmeal, to specialty crafted sandwiches and some delicious pancakes and French toast .\nThe coffee was great too. My dining partner had an orange juice which was freshly squeezed.\nIf youâ€™re in Ann Arbor in the downtown area, stop in to the Avalon for absolutely exquisite service and food that is stellar!!!",

The bacon avacado egg sandwich was good but the bread really eroded my mouth it felt like I was chewing for 3 eons, but ig thatâ€™s the case with sourdough.

Someone else brought our food out, and she did not come back to check how the food was or if we needed anything else. We had finished our food and were sitting waiting for her to come back for 30 minutes before giving up and heading inside to ask for the bill. The host told us he would find her for us and it took another 15 minutes after that for her to bring the bill out. 10 minutes later she still hadn't come back for it and it had started raining so we went inside to have them take the bill so we could leave. We got there around 9:30, were finished eating about 45 minutes later, and weren't able to leave until 11:15. I don't know if our waitress was just having an off day or if something was wrong but it was really disappointing.",

He didnâ€™t really come back to check on us. When I got up to use the restroom I spotted him chatting with the bartender instead of grabbing our checks. I saw him continuing to chat while we waited for about 15 minutes for our checks to come in.",
