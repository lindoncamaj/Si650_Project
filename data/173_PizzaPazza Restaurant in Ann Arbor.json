I had the sausage and peppers. Fantastic. The owner, Jeff, it's a friendly guy and well-versed in pizza: he's been a chef for 30 years. Great food. Great atmosphere. Absolutely make it a point to eat here, and more than once. Then, when you are completely satisfied, satiated, happy, and full of delicious pizza, write Pizza Pazza a Five Star review. They deserve it. Consider yourself lucky to have found this place - you're going to have a great meal.",

It has great flavor and is hand stretched to the perfect proportion.   The pizza base is thin but remains soft, and the crust rises nicely and has great chew.  Again, super fresh cheese, sauce and basil.  After eating the whole thing, I am left wanting just one more slice... but if it were any bigger, I would certainly be over-full.",

                "description": "This Pizza is fine. It's kind of cool to watch it get made in front of you and then put in wood burning oven. I was just really put off by how rude the man, who I think is the owner, was to his employees. There was a young man working who seemed like he was fairly new, and the owner was just so condescending to him over every little issue. And then the owner made me the wrong Pizza. He just made a different type of pizza. And I was totally fine with that and laid back and couldn't care less but it was just interesting to see him be so dismissive of his employees for minor mistakes and then he makes the completely wrong pizza. And I was the only one there.\n\nAlso, I've probably had the wrong order made for me at a pizza place or somewhere similar a dozen times in my life. And when that happens, they always give or offer to give you the wrong order as well as your correct one. I understand he's under no obligation to do that, but like what are you going to do with that pizza you made by accident? Maybe give it to me for my time, let me try it out? It's not like you're going to hand it to someone else if they happen to walk in and order that particular style lol.",

                "description": "Just tried this place and I am very impressed. The pizza was great, far superior to the other Neapolitan style places I've tried in Michigan. Glad we now have some good pizzerias in Ann Arbor. Also a fan of Joe's for New York style but their sauce is a little two sweet for my tastes.",
