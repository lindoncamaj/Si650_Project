In fact the front area in the big windows that face the outs are so full of plants. I didnâ€™t realize it was a restaurant!!!\nHopefully, that was just me as I would hate to think anybody else wouldnâ€™t see it and therefore wouldnâ€™t have a meal there.\nWe shared an appetizer that was bruschetta -I was advised it was the best ever and indeed it was. The garlic crisp bread with hummus, and very finally chopped black olives pico de gallo it was just incredibly good all of it. I would order it again in a heartbeat as my meal!\nWe all had something different. My sister enjoyed the taco salad, which is her go to there. It looked delicious but yet so healthy. My brother-in-law had enchiladas made with sweet potato frankly Iâ€™ve never had a vegetarian menu that was so diverse.!!!\nI had a Italian pizza sandwich. It had delicious pizza sauce with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil all on a delicious grilled sourdough bread.\nWe were all too far for dessert, but will have to try it next time. I am able to get there. It will definitely be a go to when Iâ€™m in A2!!!!!!",

I enjoyed it, but I felt it was missing some spices, so I added salt and pepper. My husband ordered the portabella caprese on a gluten-free bun. When the order arrived, we double-checked, and it turned out the bread was not gluten-free. We've had similar experiences at other restaurants, so we always ask twice. Since my husband and I often switch dishes to taste each other's food, we make sure everything is gluten-free. We had to wait an additional 15 minutes for them to correct the order. Despite this hiccup, I still recommend Seva, especially if you're vegan, vegetarian, or have a gluten allergy. It's a safe place to eat.",

What did surprise me was that at 4:30 pm, the half off happy hour appetizer deal doesnâ€™t apply if youâ€™re not sitting at the bar. My back doesnâ€™t do high top seating. The Detroit location honors happy hour apps as long as itâ€™s during happy hour; I donâ€™t know why there was no indication of a bar-only deal. I donâ€™t like stressing out my servers, so I didnâ€™t bring it up. But paying $90 during happy hour when youâ€™re expecting $50 just seems wrong when the other location honors it.",

                "description": "We had delicious food at our most recent visit to Seva, and the service was excellent.  They have a very creative, well-executed vegetarian menu.  The rosemary potatoes were tasty enough but were possibly microwaved (from frozen?) We were seated back by the kitchen with most of the other diners (fewer steps for the server, which is nice) but it is very noisy.  Iâ€™ll ask for a different table next time.  The prices seem high for what youâ€™re getting - I realize food prices have gone up but compared to other restaurants, the prices seem off to me.",
