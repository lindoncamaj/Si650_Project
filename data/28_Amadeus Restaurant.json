It is a Polish restaurant and you can tell that everything at this place is made from scratch cooking and made with love ðŸ’ž!! You will be paying $20-30 a plate but it is well worth it, plus it is a very hearty portion. They have a good wine selection and make sure you leave room for dessert, whatever you get, it will be good.\n\nI have worked my way through most of the menu and nothing has tasted bad, so whatever you feel like on the menu I feel confident in its taste. The service is the best in Ann Arbor, Michael is one of the greatest servers I have had at any restaurant. He is attentive, kind, always seems to come back when you need something, and is not overbearing!\n\nI seriously cannot recommend this place enough, give it a shot!!",

Limited options for vegetarian people though.\n\nService is a bit slow but no major complaints around it since the food turned out to be delicious.\n\nReserving a table ahead of time is highly recommended.",

                "description": "I feel sorry for giving such a low rating, but thatâ€™s just how their food wasâ€¦ Kielbasa (4.5/5) tastes wonderful but the portion size was so small ($12 for a single piece of sausage). The rest of the dishes are meh (2/5). Meat lacks the depth of flavors and noodles are overcooked; at this price point I was expecting more, much more actually.\n\nThe owner was super friendly so I guess I will give them a second chance after a while.",
