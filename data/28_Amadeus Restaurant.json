It is a Polish restaurant and you can tell that everything at this place is made from scratch cooking and made with love \ud83d\udc9e!! You will be paying $20-30 a plate but it is well worth it, plus it is a very hearty portion. They have a good wine selection and make sure you leave room for dessert, whatever you get, it will be good.\n\nI have worked my way through most of the menu and nothing has tasted bad, so whatever you feel like on the menu I feel confident in its taste. The service is the best in Ann Arbor, Michael is one of the greatest servers I have had at any restaurant. He is attentive, kind, always seems to come back when you need something, and is not overbearing!\n\nI seriously cannot recommend this place enough, give it a shot!!",

                "description": "the food i ordered was not bad, but the other foods my family ordered was very salty and lacked depth and flavor. one of the dishes had a pasta side dish, and the pasta honestly tasted like it had been sitting out for a solid five days. the service was alright, but the waiting time for food and appetizers was longer than expected, considering the dishes really weren\u2019t large, and there was no one else in the restaurant. the waiter was polite, but he took away our sauces (our butter) even though we weren\u2019t finished with it. i would prefer if he had asked if he could take anything away. unfortunately, the atmosphere was the only thing that received a better score, only because the interior design was pleasant. i did notice that the music repeated over and over again, which isn\u2019t the biggest deal but doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere. i would rate this restaurant a two, most of the points earned because of the atmosphere. i will not be coming here again.",

The ambience of this restaurant is phenomenal and the decoration inside is antique with many beautiful artifacts. It is a polish style restaurant where you could find variety of food and desserts. Have visited this place multiple times and will go again if I get chance. Highly recommended place and you will never regret spending money there for good food and great environment.",

The rest of the dishes are meh (2/5). Meat lacks the depth of flavors and noodles are overcooked; at this price point I was expecting more, much more actually.\n\nThe owner was super friendly so I guess I will give them a second chance after a while.",
