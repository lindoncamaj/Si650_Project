The staff member says to us \"go next door to The Kensington, they have a restaurant called Re•Lish. Way better food anyway\". So we walked next door to Re•Lish. We were glad our hotels restaurant was closed about 5mins after sitting down. Our server, Donte, was fantastic. Food was great. Our appetizer was the Corned Beef Egg Rolls, I got the Seared Mahi Mahi and my wife got the 3 PC fried chicken. Well prepared and fast service. We ended up going back the next day for breakfast, Donte was our server again (fantastic server). Really great breakfast. We are already talking about stopping in there when we travel to the Detroit Zoo (which we do quite frequently) because it is on our way.",
