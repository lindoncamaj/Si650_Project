We were glad our hotels restaurant was closed about 5mins after sitting down. Our server, Donte, was fantastic. Food was great. Our appetizer was the Corned Beef Egg Rolls, I got the Seared Mahi Mahi and my wife got the 3 PC fried chicken. Well prepared and fast service. We ended up going back the next day for breakfast, Donte was our server again (fantastic server). Really great breakfast.
