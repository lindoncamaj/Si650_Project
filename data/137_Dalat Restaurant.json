She's finally retired after 27 years running this business as a chef\nand owner. Her daughter-in-law, Tran Nguyen, has taken over the family business and moved it to the current location (2216 S. Main St.,\nAnn Arbor, Mi 48103). Tran has maintained most menu items and improved them with premium ingredients.\n\nMENU\n\nNotice: Menu Items & Prices are subject to change.\n\nhttps://www.dalatrestaurantannarbor.com 4/16\nAPPETIZERS\n\n1.

Bean sprouts, lime, basil leaves and jalape\u00f1os served on a side plate to use as desired.\n\nPho tai nam is a  traditional Vietnamese beef-base rice noodles soup with medium well-done sliced beef, beef brisket topped with onions & cilantro.  They have many other dishes besides the noodle soups.  For lunch there are different specials as well such as Benito boxes. They offer sit down service or pick up.  The staff waits on you quickly.  If you pay with credit card there is a extra charge.  When paying in cash they will discount the bill given to you.\n4-23-2024 Stopped by again and decided to try something new. B\u00e1nh x\u00e8o.  It is a piece of pan-fried golden crispy cr\u00eape filled with shrimp & chicken (or pork), mushrooms, beansprouts and onions. On the side they give you a sweet and sour sauce to use with it.  I never had this before but I am wondering if mine was over cooked.  It was very crispy and brown not golden.  On the internet when you look up this dish it looks yellow almost resembling an egg omelet in appearance.  It seemed like a very greasy dish.  I also got the Spring rolls.  My mistake to order to fried dishes together.  Way to much oil.  I won't try this again.  The Pho is way too good to get this dish.  I will try to included photos.",

                "description": "After reading extreme pro/con reviews and owner's idc responses, I had to try this place myself. It was fine. Fresh ingredients, not overcooked, 5 minutes at lunch hour, not huge proportions. my bad for not noting the dish I ordered. Plenty of seating inside and a little spot around the corner if you want to eat outdoors. If I had any suggestion, it would be to order Medium or ask for more spice on to go order.",

All the ingredients tasted very fresh. We also split #25 Xao Ca Ri, and it was also very good. Everything was seasoned just right. Go at lunchtime as they do have specials. Location was easy to find, and the atmosphere was very inviting.",

I did not really liked their noodle(bun), but the broth had good enough spiciness and nicely balanced layers of different flavors. Their pho was also very authentic. The prices are also quite reasonable, considering the crazy inflation nowadays. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone seeking for an authentic Vietnamese joint.",
