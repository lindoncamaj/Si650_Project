                "description": "Wow! One of the best places I\u2019ve eaten post covid. The food tastes like it came out of your grandmas kitchen. Real ingredients, real food and the price was just right. I enjoyed everything I had from the chocolate martini to the stuffed cabbage and schnitzel and noodles. It is decorated so cute and the staff is inviting. Very with the visit in the small town of Dexter",

The Wife had the schnitzel and that was really good too.  The side salad with blue cheese was extremely fresh and full of dark leafy greens and not just pointless iceberg.  Great that they have Franziskaner hefeweizen on tap too!  Waitress was very kind.   Interior was very nice with an appropriate old German feel (AND CLEAN!!!).  Highly recommended.",

                "description": "Stopped by because of the sign on the highway. The food is great, the waitress was so friendly, attentive to every table, and informational. The chocolate torte was the star with the texture somewhere between a ganache and a flourless chocolate cake. I would go back just for the desserts. The wursts are all fine ground and rather spongy, which usually isn\u2019t what I\u2019d go for but they were delicious nonetheless. We had the haus platter for two between two people. It could honestly feed four.\n\nEdit: Went again and the soups are consistently delicious. The potato pancakes were crispy and paired well with applesauce. The strudel and bread pudding was good, but not worth coming out here for like the chocolate torte. If a dessert doesn\u2019t specify homemade, they brought it in but made locally. The house special sauerbraten was unfortunately and surprisingly not good. It traditionally uses a tough cut of meat and it shows. Tough, dry, and a little reminiscent of cat food. No amount of marinating can save eye of round when it\u2019s cooked this hard.",

However, the potato pancakes were perfectly crispy and well balanced. My husband rated the Reuben a 4/5, he\u2019s had better but would order it again.
