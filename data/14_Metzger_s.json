Great that they have Franziskaner hefeweizen on tap too!  Waitress was very kind.   Interior was very nice with an appropriate old German feel (AND CLEAN!!!).  Highly recommended.",

                "description": "Stopped by because of the sign on the highway. The food is great, the waitress was so friendly, attentive to every table, and informational. The chocolate torte was the star with the texture somewhere between a ganache and a flourless chocolate cake. I would go back just for the desserts. The wursts are all fine ground and rather spongy, which usually isn’t what I’d go for but they were delicious nonetheless. We had the haus platter for two between two people. It could honestly feed four.\n\nEdit: Went again and the soups are consistently delicious. The potato pancakes were crispy and paired well with applesauce. The strudel and bread pudding was good, but not worth coming out here for like the chocolate torte. If a dessert doesn’t specify homemade, they brought it in but made locally. The house special sauerbraten was unfortunately and surprisingly not good. It traditionally uses a tough cut of meat and it shows. Tough, dry, and a little reminiscent of cat food. No amount of marinating can save eye of round when it’s cooked this hard.",

The waitress was very hurried the entire time, rushing us during ordering and throughout the evening. We ordered and food came out quickly. The salmon pasta was just average at best. However, the potato pancakes were perfectly crispy and well balanced. My husband rated the Reuben a 4/5, he’s had better but would order it again. Overall, prices are quite steep for the amount and flavor of the food. Overall, not a horrible experience, but likely not a place we would return to again.",
