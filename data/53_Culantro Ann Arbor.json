I ordered the chicken (pollo a la braso), and it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The rice was also fluffy and well-seasoned. Their service was friendly and accommodating as well. I ordered it another day for delivery and it was still great. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this chicken. If their other dishes are this high quality then this restaurant deserves a Michelin star.",
