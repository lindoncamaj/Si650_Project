Im so glad we did because this was some of the best Indian food we’ve had in a long time. Everything we got tasted amazing. Even my husband loved everything and he always complains about something when we eat somewhere or bring it home. My husband got the shrimp vindaloo, me and my daughter got chicken tikka masala, and my son got the shrimp tikka. We also got vegetable pakodas and the cheese kulchas.",

The decor was lovely, even the tables had beautiful painted sceens on them. Got the veg samosas, punugulu, and butter chicken, and it all looked and tasted fantastic. The samosas were a surprise, with a well seasoned and spicy filling. The punugulu had two dipping sauces, one sweet and one a bit spicy that complemented the seasoned fried dough wonderfully. The butter chicken was full of flavor, and the chicken was very tender. Everything was well seasoned with just enough spice. It came out to $30 with enough to feed two! I was only able to eat half, took the rest home, and my brother ate it. His first time eating Indian cuisine as well, and he loved it all! Hope to get an opportunity to come back someday!",

Next time so will bring my own when I come back.\nOverall food is average, samosa smells some kind of oil. Food is not a good class food. I would say below average.",

The menu offers a variety of delicious dishes, but I particularly enjoy the Bullet Naan and Keema Naan, which pair perfectly with curries like Mughlai Chicken, Hariyani Chicken, and Chettinadu Lamb. The prices are very reasonable, especially considering that each curry comes with complimentary rice. Another standout item on the menu is the Vegetable Cutlet, which makes for an excellent appetizer. Overall, this place offers great value for money and consistently delivers on taste and service.",

                "description": "The food was not authentic, tasteless, bland, and poorly made. Being an Indian visiting Michigan this week, I had an opportunity to try food here. I would definitely steer far away from this place and eat at other cuisines for the rest of my stay. Not sure how they are surviving given such a low standard of quality. Wouldn't recommend it.",

                "description": "This restaurant has an excellent chef but weak management. The service part is almost missing. We were the only family dining in, still the  waiter missed one of our orders. Waiter won’t come back to ask if you need anything else, not even dessert! He brought the bill as soon as he finished serving the dishes. We felt rushed. However, the food was absolutely delicious. If I ever go back, it’ll be just for the taste. The overall experience was quite mixed.",
