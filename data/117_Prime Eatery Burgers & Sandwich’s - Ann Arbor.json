My favorite they have is the smash burgers, waffles fries, mac and cheese bits, chicken nuggets and I like their original prime sauce. They come in clutch if your starving or want a snack late night because they open late. What you see in the photo is the chicken nuggets, mac and cheese bits, and cajun fries.",

I had no wait when ordering and the person that helped me out was helpful and took his time as it was the first time I was there and I was still looking at what I wanted to have. The ordering was seamless and there was and option to add hot Cheetos which I liked. The wait wasn\u2019t too long and once I received my food it was a good amount and it was really good and it just had a good mix of everything that was in the bowl. The atmosphere was also good as there was music playing and a tv with a show going on. I really enjoyed the place and will probably come back again when I am in the Ann Arbor area. I really recommend this place and what it has to offer.",

Which i was not mad at all, the cashier lady was very apologetic and gave us extra meat because we waited a kinda long. But honestly for some people may not so i hope in the future they will have more people working because i just know this place will get busy when school starts again.\n\nTables were little bit dirty, which I understand they only had 1 person working in the front she was very humble and very kind and she cares about her customers she always checks on us if they needed anything like bags or anything\u2026..\n\nBut overall this place is a must try with very good price with good amount of food.",

Wished they used fresher chicken didn\u2019t over cook it for the price :(",

The bowls I tried were absolutely delicious\u2014packed with flavor and perfectly prepared. I'm confident that everything else on the menu is equally fantastic, but for now, I'll be sticking to their bowls because they are truly awesome. Highly recommended!",
