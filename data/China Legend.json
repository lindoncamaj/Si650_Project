                "description": "Finally!! A Chinese restaurant that serves the quality food in the area. The recent reviews from the past couple of months were near flawless, and I just had to give them a try. They did not disappoint. The bourbon chicken was amazing, the portions size was generous and the taste was great. Same with the beef and broccoli, the beef was actually tender tasty, and not chewy and cheap. Also, the broccoli was so green and fresh and crunchy, I was so impressed. Best of all, they don’t drown their dishes in sauce unnecessarily! My ONLY critique is that their eggrolls are not up to par with my own personal preference in regard to NY style chine food. They weren’t terrible, but they certainly have room for improvement. If they fixed their eggrolls, they would be unstoppable in my opinion. I honestly hope they put their local competition out of business. This is how Chinese food should be prepared and served. Don’t hesitate for a second to consider this restaurant. I hope their business will continue to thrive for a long time.",

                "description": "LEGENDARY!  We gave up on Chinese food after moving to Tampa 3 years ago from California where great Chinese food was everywhere.  It felt amazing to know we have a Chinese food restaurant 15 minutes away that is even better than California.  The Hunan Pork was to die for, General Tso’s Chicken was hard to stop eating, the dumplings felt like they had just been made and the wrapper was just the right amount of soft yet textured.  Egg rolls tasted home made and crispy outside with lush filling.  The hot and sour soup was delicious and just the right amount of spicy and my son said the steamed rice was spectacular and he was right.  It is so easy to ruin rice, but this was fluffy, tasty and not at all gooey or sticky.  Obviously with that great starting rice, their fried rice was nothing short of amazing.  The owner was very friendly and spoke to us after our meal.  A family business that I hope is around forever.  They deserve the high rating and so much more.",

I have never seen pad Thai at any Chinese restaurant in Tampa so I thought that was pretty cool…also was impressed they included been sprouts and topped with peanuts…whenever I order pad Thai from other restaurants it’s usually missing one or the other.\n\nSecond trip I got bourbon chicken and spring rolls…and this was the best bourbon chicken I’ve had in a long time! I also got sesame chicken for my daughter and she loved it. Oh and I got crab Rangoon…this was soooo good.\n\nThird trip, today, I got the house special fried rice…and yes…spring rolls…lol. I love trying new things but the spring rolls are always a must…they are too good to pass up, but yes, the rice was also delicious.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and welcoming, and they keep the restaurant VERY clean and tidy. This is a huge selling point for me…and to top it off…the food is actually really good. They stand out from any other Chinese restaurant I’ve ever eaten at here in Tampa.\n\nChina Legend is truly legendary. ✌🏻",
