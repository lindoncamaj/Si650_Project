I have been going back periodically over that time and have always ordered the Super Sub. I still believe it is one of the best sandwiches in Ann Arbor. I hear their pizza is good, but I always end up getting the Super Sub because it is so consistently delicious. If you buy a bottle of chapati sauce and pour it on a Super Sub, you will be brought tremendous joy. Shakes are my favorite too. Love this place.",

Only 3 coin parking for entire strip so we had to park couple blocks away and walk.",

                "description": "Sadly, Pizza Bob's moved from its previous location and the city has eliminated any local parking so old memories were lost and older folks will have less access to foods from their past. All of the foods are still available. I suggest utilizing the pick up option.  Keep reading. I had the chipati, which was excellent and two pizzas, also delicious if you don't want the memorable, abundant, stretchy cheese.  The cheese and the toppings were scant, sadly. The sauce was ample and delicious. The dough was tasty.  Sizes are newly named. \"We have no medium,\" so ordering a large, gets you a medium. Shakes a \"dumbed\" down. Instead of actual hot fudge that clings to the side of the cup, you get a homogeneous shake.  :-(  Bob's old counter, lost to the dumpster.",
