Once seated given water and abandoned with our tablet menus for 12 minutes. Once orders submitted, several items were not delivered (soups), we had to ask for bread before we were served. Vegetarian meal was considered plentiful and good as were their classics. The mobile delivery is interesting but I still do not see the benefit service wise. The waitstaff non-attentive to our table after meals delivered. Overall good food, bad table service.",

                "description": "I recently visited Palm Palace, a Mediterranean/Arabic restaurant, and had a great overall experience. The food was delicious and came at a fair price, especially considering the generous portions. One of the highlights was the freshly baked bread, which was served warm and complemented the meal perfectly. The chicken shawarma hummus was outstanding \u2014 the shawarma was tender, flavorful, and paired wonderfully with the creamy hummus. I highly recommend it to anyone dining here.\n\nThe menu offers a good variety of Mediterranean dishes, and everything we ordered tasted fresh and authentic. The flavors were well-balanced, and you could tell that quality ingredients were used. For the price, the portions were more than satisfying, making it a great value for the money.\n\nThe only downside of the evening was that they were out of Almaza, a Lebanese beer I was really looking forward to trying. While it was disappointing, it wasn\u2019t enough to dampen the overall experience, especially given how enjoyable the food was. I\u2019ll definitely be back to try more items on the menu and hopefully get a chance to sample Almaza next time.\n\nOverall, Palm Palace is a solid choice for anyone craving Mediterranean or Arabic cuisine. The food is well-prepared, the portions are hearty, and the prices are reasonable. Despite the minor hiccup with the beer, I\u2019ll certainly be returning for another meal. Highly recommend!",

She was professional and personable, efficient and helped us find the perfect items on the menu for each one of us.\n(The food was very good!)\n\nA fun side note, there is also an electric cart that comes along with the server to help service with a cute screen on it. It reminded us of Rosie the maid on the old cartoon the Jetsons. It added to the efficiency of the meal and we actually really enjoyed the novelty as well as the helpful delivery of our items.\n\nThe menus are iPads, one for each guest. Then you place your order with the server.  It is the best digital menu that I have ever seen.  It is intuitive, clear, concise The pictures are just the right size.  I didn't get confused once. We all easily navigated around the digital menu.  It is Well done! They must have spent a lot of time on curating the interaction and menu experience.  It was very helpful in ordering.\n\nThe food is very good. Very generous servings.   Try the rice pudding. It is lovely.  They were very very busy even though it was Monday after the lunch hour.\n\nWe will go back the next time we are in town!\nThis is definitely worth the trip out of downtown Ann Arbor. You will be so happy you tried the Palm Palace! -\u2764\ufe0fBH",

The food came out so fast! This place is family own and MAN do they know how to entertain large crowds fast! I came in around 5:45pm on a Friday right before dinner rush, and everyone that came in after me was served just as quickly. It looked like the kitchen wasn't even phased.\nThe BREAD! OMG THE BREAD! and the garlic butter was out of this world! It was baked right in their oven fresh (really fun to watch, ask to be close or go watch them do their thing!) And they fill a bag Togo! \ud83e\udd2f\nI had the Tabulee (highest quality with quantity), Shish Tawook with potato wedges. Heavy chicken serving hot and moist cubes - how?! Everything was so incredible, it will be a staple for me to go to EVERY time I'm in Ann Arbor. I also HAD to get their freshly made juice, their power blend (beet, carrot, apple, celery) which I couldn't make the quantity for that price - unbeatable!\nSOOOOOOOO good!
