Food was reasonably priced, not the best Mexican food I've had but not the worst. Drinks were delicious, especially liked the margarita with fresh fruit blended in. Had a few N/A non-alcoholic options, most were soda-based unfortunately, horchata was great though!",

Dirty dishes, a margarita served in a tall glass, wine served in a dirty glass, water served in a dirty glass. This is my first experience here and it did not leave a good impression. The food was okay? I was not really enthused by the food. It seemed low quality for the price. The rice for my fajitas seemed under done, the fajita vegetables were lack luster really only being onion that didn’t have any char. My partner want happy with his food and for us spending almost 70 bucks, I expected better.",

                "description": "Tíos is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Ann Arbor. I’ve been coming here for years now! The tacos are a great price and SUPER TASTY — my friends and I love the papa (potato) taco, the fish taco and the shrimp taco; if you eat pork, I also like the Al pastor taco. Their enchiladas, nachos and quesadillas are always delicious, too, as well as their drinks! I’m not kidding when I say I’ve had their margaritas delivered to my house before. I prefer the classic margarita, but the strawberry margarita is always a hit. This is getting long…but I’d be crazy to leave out the churros 🤤. Overall, great food and great price.",

                "description": "I was sad earlier today as I came just after noon and the doors were locked. A server came out to let us know they were closed as they had too many online orders and not enough staff to open, but that they would probably be open in an hour or so. Sadly, we left.\n\nWell, as fate would have it, our dinner choice didn't work out, so we came back here for dinner. And they were open! So glad, too! The prices are a bit more expensive than I'm used to (inflation? Yay...), but the food is worth it! ($12 for Guac.) I ordered guacamole that came with chips and salsa. The hot salsa was good,  but I preferred the sweetness of the medium (I didn't go for the mild as I wanted some heat). I have no regrets! So good! Husband ordered a wide selection of tacos. They were gone before I could snap a pic, lol. Highly recommend! And if they're closed, it's worth checking back later ;)",
