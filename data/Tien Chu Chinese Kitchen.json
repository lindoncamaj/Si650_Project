I recently tried their fried scallops they we’re very delicious and perfect if you just want a snack. from my own experience and observation especially since they reopened after Covid they are clean and courteous establishment but most of all and very important they keep an A from the department of health and for that you deserve 5 stars keep up the good work !",

I called in to place an order and the lady read my order back but I changed my order from pork fried rice to fried rice and she screamed at me saying that’s not what I said. I told her I wanted fried rice instead and she asked me what’s wrong with me and to make up my mind. Never in my life has anyone been rude to me for changing my order . She’s so lucky I calmed myself down because I would’ve drove there and gave her a piece of my mind!! Even when I’ve ordered in person in the past she’d walk away without saying one moment , or even a hi. Whenever I’d tell her “thank you” after getting my order she’d just walk away and not say a word back. Yesterday was my last straw with that place! You can’t talk to your customers whatever type of way! I deleted their number. I’m done with that place!",

I'm glad I asked them to put it on the side. So I could use it sparingly. Shrimp fried rice was small shrimps and not cleaned. It will not be a frequent place I visit.\n\nYou would think after all of what these Chinese restaurants have been through with the coronavirus they would be top-notch with their customer service. But they're not it's business as usual. The majority of them just do not appreciate their customers. And it shows with their abrupt rude rapport with their customers.",
