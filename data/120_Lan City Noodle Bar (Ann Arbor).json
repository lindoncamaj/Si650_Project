Their chicken in the sesame chicken was also delicious - so much meat and the perfect amount of breading. The crab Rangoon were pretty good but not the best in town I‚Äôd say.\nThis place is seat yourself. You order at the counter, take a buzzer, and find a seat. It can get busy but usually there‚Äôs space to sit.",

There‚Äôs just something that you have to love about fresh noodles and appropriately balanced flavors that just soothes one‚Äôs soul, and Lan City Noodle Bar definitely hits that spot.\n\nI like the variety of flavors, noodles, and small plates. Many dishes go well together and I end up getting different combinations each time I go (though my son prefers the dumplings always).\n\nVery straightforward and outgoing ladies have taken my order every time I‚Äôve been there, and explained the system for picking up your food. Things can stagger when they come out, so the best bet if you are really hungry may just be to order more (we generally order 4-6 items so something usually comes out quick).\n\nLove this place, don‚Äôt change, and keep the wings spicy!",

Ordering was super easy and sat down with a pager, but the wait time was ~20 minutes. The food was okay, we loved the hot chili oil noodles especially (FYI it was spicy), but the pad Thai didn‚Äôt taste like pad Thai at all. The sesame chicken sauce was good, but the chicken bites were very large and hard to eat. After a few pieces of chicken we couldn‚Äôt eat the rest. The atmosphere of the restaurant was good and was overall very clean.",

I asked for vegetable noodle soup with vegetable broth and double checked with them to make sure it was vegetarian, but for some reason it included a fly, which (last time I checked) isn't vegetarian?\n\nI brought this to the attention of the manager, and she told me it was seaweed. I've never seen seaweed with wings, but maybe they use a special kind of seaweed? She then stirred it around to make sure the flying seaweed was at the bottom of the bowl and harder to see. I showed her a picture of what she claimed to be seaweed and she panicked and offered to get me another bowl of the flying seaweed soup, free of charge. Unfortunately, since I'm vegetarian, I can't eat flies, so I declined her kind offer.\n\nYou can be the judge of that picture down below. Maybe I'm wrong? I wasn't the best in biology, so maybe I missed the part in class where they taught us that seaweed grows wings after being cooked.\n\nOnly reason this isn't a one star review is because their classic fried rice is good as hell and that one lady on the staff who is usually there is really nice.",
