But not only that, they have diverse options some of which I have seen nowhere. Our waitress was super respectful about our dietary restrictions, recommended the plates by herself, warned if something like veg but was not and made sure that they are followed. Something that I have rarely experienced at Japanese restaurants. Loved the place and overall experience.",

You are instantly greeted by the staff; as well as gorgeous My Neighbor Totoro decor! Best sushi spot in Michigan in my opinion. We ordered hot tea, miso soup, the best gyoza around, a crunchy spiced California roll, a Yam Yam specialty roll, and two tempura ice creams. Perfect price points, in comparison to other eats near by. Will be back",
