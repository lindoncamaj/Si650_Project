A mix?  When the train would pass by people would start clapping. Lots of big groups were present but even then, we had quick service. The fish was amazing and coconut rice was amazing! They had run out of steak my husband wanted but he loved  his chicken and tortellini dish!  Paul our server was very kind! He certainly made our anniversary dinner worth it! Kudos to the chef! Everything was great! We would definitely come again!",

We had to ask him for a drink and again he didn’t bother to ask if we needed anything.\nHe seemed to be rushing when we weren’t ready to order and when we were ready, he was ignoring us and taking care of the table next to us.\nWhile reserving I had mentioned that we were there to celebrate my husband’s birthday but they didn’t even bother to ask about it.",

                "description": "Came for an anniversary dinner. We were well taken care of throughout the meal. Our server gave dish recommendations, one of which my husband ordered and loved (blackened fish with dynamite topping). I’m not a huge seafood person, so I opted for the Cajun tortellini. It was delicious, but very greasy, so beware of those empty calories. I felt very full having eaten just half of my dinner. Definitely a pricier dining location but the Gandy Dancer is a must try in Ann Arbor for fresh seafood dishes. You’ll get a more upscale dining experience, without a chophouse price tag! The bread and dessert alone are enough to bring me back to dine here again.",

Zoe, our waitress was a highly trained professional that was on the ball, good natured and surprised us with her attentiveness to detail. Her surprise was to have head chef Lauren, congratulate my wife and I on our 50th anniversary. This was a very special moment her cream Brulé is indescribably delicious. But all the entrées and side dishes were exceptional and flavorful and delightful. In your bucket list do not overlook this place. it is outstanding and worth, the value you receive from everyone. My love to my in-laws for being so generous for this wonderful occasion. The initial and final experience that was over the top was our valet Jaden, who was exceptional, kind, considerate employee of this fantastic establishment. Everyone of these people deserve to be recognized for their exceptional professional love for this establishment again thank you for making our 50th wedding anniversary celebration, a wonderful event, I will never forget you",

It really brings in the history of the old train station. I'm glad we went to Oasis because we probably never would have tried this place. You should definitely check the place out yourself, I'm sure you won't regret it. Thank you again for the great food and service.",

We made a reservation over the phone a few weeks prior for five people.\n\nThe only good thing about this restaurant is that I learned the meaning behind the term \"Gandy Dancer\". The food was not good and the service matched. To say the least, they over cooked our steaks and no one seemed to care. This restaurant is also pretty expensive. It’s odd to me that people question what they should wear to a restaurant that does not show up for them.\n\nI would not go back, and would not recommend. Do not waste your money.",
