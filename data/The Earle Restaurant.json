I enjoyed my eggplant dish after requesting extra sauce. The sauce was AMAZING! other members of the party reported that the meals were enjoyable but nothing to crave.\n\nThe service was good, but not exceptional or impressive.\n\nNice atmosphere. I‚Äôd visit again, but not on as a regular occurrence.\n\nMy party REALLY liked Risotto balls and got 3 orders.",

Her name is Caitlin, she is very knowledgeable about not only the wine list they offer but wine in general. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed.\n\nThe last time I went was for my birthday üéÇ and I got the beef tenderloin with Roquefort and it was Devine!! The pumpkin cheesecake cake I got was just as good and the wines we had were spot on!!\n\nThis is going to be a little pricey then some restaurants but pretty on par for the better places in Ann Arbor, about 25-45 a plate üçΩÔ∏è. If you are going in the weekend, make a reservation. Definitely give this place a go though!!",

The food was innovative and delicious, it was very hard to settle on what dish to order. That's usually my first clue I'm going to love it and return for the other options! The cocktails were unique and delicious. Our server Marisa was perfectly knowledgeable, attentive, and sweet. The jazz music was sublime and tended towards love songs my partner and I recognized.

We‚Äôve never had a bad experience, either in service or victuals.  The entertainment is always a great addition to a wonderful dinner. Last night was no exception. I had the Delmonico steak and my wife had the salmon puff pastry. Wow. My steak was amazingly seasoned and cooked perfectly. My wife‚Äôs dish was equally as good‚Ä¶she compared it to the Hells Kitchen Beef Wellington we had some years back, and it was much better.\nThis should be your go-to restaurant if you want a great dining experience.",

All the benefits of a high class restaurant without the \"stress\" or intensity of some places.\n\nThe menu offers diverse, sophisticated choices but is still simple...quality, not quantity. My favorites are the duck breast (the sauce is OUT OF THIS WORLD & I don't even like fruit!), escargot puffed pastry, risotto appetizer, and salmon puffed pastry, though there's a lot I still have yet to try.",
