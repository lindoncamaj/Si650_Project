It was only when they got the bill that we realized that the bill was significantly higher than we expected. They also recently decreased the value of their happy hour and have sub par drinks especially for the price. If you have a choice I would recommend another Ann Arbor bar. Their food is average with limited options but satisfactory",

She gave so many recommendations and was so sweet! Otherwise, I really was not satisfied with Charley\u2019s. I did see the manager getting upset with the servers and it made me upset. Looks like their management was intolerable and the food was fine I guess.",

                "description": "Would not recommend. Went at 9:45 on a Friday night. Waitress was very inattentive. We asked for things from our order at least twice after we ordered. We never got one if the items we asked for. Waitress didn't really check in, had to chase her down to get ketchup. Left her a 7% tip (I'm a pretty good tipper generally) and spoke to the manager about why I was leaving a crappy tip. Manager said \"sorry\", but didn't really seem interested in our beef. Our first and probably last visit. Might be nice place if you're going out with a bunch of friends, you aren't Ina hurry, and don't mind not getting things you ordered. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
