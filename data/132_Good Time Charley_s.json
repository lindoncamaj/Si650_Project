It was only when they got the bill that we realized that the bill was significantly higher than we expected. They also recently decreased the value of their happy hour and have sub par drinks especially for the price. If you have a choice I would recommend another Ann Arbor bar. Their food is average with limited options but satisfactory",

We never got one if the items we asked for. Waitress didn't really check in, had to chase her down to get ketchup. Left her a 7% tip (I'm a pretty good tipper generally) and spoke to the manager about why I was leaving a crappy tip. Manager said \"sorry\", but didn't really seem interested in our beef. Our first and probably last visit. Might be nice place if you're going out with a bunch of friends, you aren't Ina hurry, and don't mind not getting things you ordered. 🤷🏼‍♂️",
