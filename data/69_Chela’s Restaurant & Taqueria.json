Tacos (should) come with salsa already, so paying for an empty container is a rip off.\n\nThe carne asada tacos were decent; the meat was a bit tough and no salt. They come with one lime and a measly bunch of cilantro and onion.\n\nThe pork tamale was something I would not get again. Moist but no taste at all. It is lacking any type of salt; don\u2019t be fooled by the green sauce inside, that\u2019s also flavorless!\n\nThe items unfortunately only had flavor when I dumped hot salsa all over them. As a Mexican-American, this place does not serve quality food. I\u2019d rather make the drive to Detroit for authentic and fair priced Mexican food! Primos Tacos is my favorite spot. It was worth a try.",

The staff are all really friendly,  and the food is Fantastic!  I can see why they were rated best Mexican restaurant in Ann Arbor for 2023!  The food is truly authentic,  and it is delicious!  Try the Cubana torta!",

They give you self-serve hot sauce options which was great. I'd also recommend upgrading daily special menu by $0.5 to enjoy Mexican soda.",

Didn't even get the salsa that was supposed to come with the quesadilla. I've been to Chela's multiple times in the past but this recent takeout order was such a disappointment I wouldn't go back.",
