The complimentary bread was amazing and set the tone for a great meal. I ordered the grilled BBQ chicken with veggies and rice, and the rice was particularly memorable, reminiscent of flavorful biryani. The host was both cute and beautiful, adding a pleasant touch to the evening. The service was attentive and friendly, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, the restaurant offers free ample parking, which is a definite plus. Overall, a satisfying dining experience that exceeded expectations.",

After waiting for over 30 minutes the ribeyes came well done and dry, the potatos were super salty and also dry and one of the ribs came almost like a charcoal, super burned and black, we returned that rib no even a dog could eat it, and they brought another piece  of rib almost 15 mins lataer or when we were finishing eating the over cooked and dry beef, we order a Blue Moon and the second one the glass was broken on the border, I returned it and they offered me another one and I said no, enough, I was already fed off and ready to leave the place for the bad service and low food quality, it was a very bad experience, several issues in the food quality and service, I will not recommend this place to my friends and with me they lost one customer.

Literally couldn’t eat it.\nServer sent the manager over - her resolution was to let the kitchen staff know to use less salt for the next customer.\nIf you’re looking for a salt lick for dinner…. You’ve found your spot",
