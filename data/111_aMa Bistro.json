I tried to look past it and then when I received my bill, she dropped the clipboard that the receipt is attached to on the table, not even looking at me, and just walking away.\n\nThe experience just continued to get worse and I just got overall very bad vibes from the waitress.\nI was respectful the whole service and I understand that everyone has those days when they're not feeling it, but I felt unappreciated, especially being that I was a regular here. She seemed very kind with everyone else but in a way, ignored me.\n\nAgain, the food was great but the service left a horrible taste in my mouth.\n\nDon't see myself walking back in here.",

My daughter had poached eggs and fruit, my wife had pumpkin nut bread bread french toast and I had one of the best gyros ever!  In fact, everyone was very happy with their meal and service was excellent!  We did eat inside but didn't stress as the owners have done a nice job keeping customers safe.",
