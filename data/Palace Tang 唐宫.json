I came with my child, and as soon as we walked in, the staff kindly asked if we needed a high chair and prepared it for us, along with a child-friendly fork. When my child started crying during the meal, a staff member quickly noticed and brought over a toy to calm them down, making us feel truly cared for. Besides the attentive service, the food here is also excellent. I’ll definitely bring more friends here, as the food is delicious, and the service is truly thoughtful—a rare combination!",

Sauce bar is pretty damn delicious, and they have tons of meat delicacies imported from East Asia. All meat and veggies were really delicious. Bean curd sheet tasted like a bandaid. I am hopeful they update that one. Head waitress is extremely personable. Will definitely return for special occasions.",

The $18 premium Wagyu beef is now thinner, smaller, and more fatty than before. The 1 meter cow has also shrunk and isn't as good as it used to be.\nThe soup tastes different too—it's just very salty without the rich meat flavor, so I had to add water.\nI was really excited when this hot pot place first opened but now I’m quite disappointed.\nI’m giving it 3 stars for its past taste, friendly staff and the clean restaurant.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review:\nI love this place.
