They have many healthy options, including salads and bowls... they offer suggested bowls, plus build-your-own options \u2014 more than any other spot in town. Because it is a new place I am willing to try it a few times to give them time to get everything right. I ordered the Korean barbecue pork rice bowl, only they ran out of pork so we substituted beef. The steak in my bowl was warm, not hot. The food assembly was good until the last station, they forgot to add the house made BBQ sauce. And I only noticed that because the bowl was rather dry. So I had to go back for that. The beef was well done and a bit chewy. The drinks are all natural and quite refreshing. Everything is competitively priced. All in all it was a better than average experience with room for some improvements. Next time I\u2019ll try the Cobb salad and see if I can adjust my rating up.",

I was at home isolating, recuperating from Covid. Having eaten about one third of my bowl I suddenly bit into a bean-sized piece of what turned out to be very hard plastic. The impact vibrated my jaw and I was very fortunate not to break a tooth. Needless to say I was stunned and pissed!\n\nI sat motionless for a few moments contemplating my intended actions. Had I been well I might stormed into the store and thrown the plastic at one of the workers! I even considered the possibility of a lawsuit. But sanity prevailed, I got up, tossed the remainder of the bowl into the trash. And, vowed to \u201cNEVER FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN!\u201d  I recommend the same to others.",

Food is high quality, reasonably priced and so so so good! It's actually my favorite  restaurant!! The fountain drinks are special too. I enjoy each flavor but my very favorite is the mandarin orange and cardamom. To eat healthy and treat yourself at the same time ! Well that just does not happen very often.
