They have many healthy options, including salads and bowls... they offer suggested bowls, plus build-your-own options — more than any other spot in town. Because it is a new place I am willing to try it a few times to give them time to get everything right. I ordered the Korean barbecue pork rice bowl, only they ran out of pork so we substituted beef. The steak in my bowl was warm, not hot. The food assembly was good until the last station, they forgot to add the house made BBQ sauce. And I only noticed that because the bowl was rather dry. So I had to go back for that. The beef was well done and a bit chewy. The drinks are all natural and quite refreshing. Everything is competitively priced. All in all it was a better than average experience with room for some improvements. Next time I’ll try the Cobb salad and see if I can adjust my rating up.",

I was at home isolating, recuperating from Covid. Having eaten about one third of my bowl I suddenly bit into a bean-sized piece of what turned out to be very hard plastic. The impact vibrated my jaw and I was very fortunate not to break a tooth. Needless to say I was stunned and pissed!\n\nI sat motionless for a few moments contemplating my intended actions. Had I been well I might stormed into the store and thrown the plastic at one of the workers! I even considered the possibility of a lawsuit. But sanity prevailed, I got up, tossed the remainder of the bowl into the trash. And, vowed to “NEVER FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN!”  I recommend the same to others.",
