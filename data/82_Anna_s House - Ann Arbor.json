We put our order in at 2 p.m. they close at 3 one of the reasons we got to go. I ordered candied pecan and banana French toast for my young son 7 and a monte cristo for my husband, both of which were just plain bread, not dipped in French toast egg batter. As you can imagine, my 7 year old wouldn\u2019t eat his food. If this had been a cheap place I wouldn\u2019t leave a negative review, but I\u2019m honestly so flabbergasted that they would just put some slices of plain bread in a to go box with some toppings and I paid 16 dollars for this.  I usually am amazed with everything Anna\u2019s is, the food, the service , everything is usually great and is why it is my favorite  restaurant and is usually worth the prices. Today I am beyond disappointed, being in the service industry myself I would never serve food like this to someone. Attaching pictures of their stock photo and what I received.",

The chicken and waffles are perfection (pictured below), along with the Billion Dollar Bacon and Cinnamon Monkey Bread for table starters.  The entire menu looks great!

As a vegan, it\u2019s hard to find worthwhile breakfast restaurants but the food here is SO worth the price and there truly is something for everyone.
