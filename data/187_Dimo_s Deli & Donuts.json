The old man can seem rude, but I think it's just his raspy accent and need to be efficient. When you've got a line out to the parking lot, you gotta move orders. Once business had calmed, he chatted with some customers. As my wife and I were packing up to go, he checked on us and made sure our food was good. He offered boxes and refills too. The atmosphere here was perfect.\n\nI would highly recommend Dimo's, just make sure you know what you want ahead of time ðŸ˜† the old man isn't afraid to call you out.",

Soo good!!!\nFlavors: Blueberry, Raspberry, Strawberry, Apple, Buttercream and Custard ðŸ˜‹\n\nApple fritters, donuts, and sandwiches are the best in town! Better than Zingerman's Deli in my opinion. Sandwiches are monster sized and great selection to choose from...plus burgers and fries!\n\nHidden in the menu is a falafel sandwich or platter that's great on a summer day. Love the owner and his humor. Brings a smile and laugh to all who walk through his door. ðŸ˜‚\n\nUpdate Dec 2021... pics of Turkey Club and Grilled Ham and Cheese sandwiches! Plus order of hash browns with cheddar cheese and veggies! Of course, yummy donuts!",
