The old man can seem rude, but I think it's just his raspy accent and need to be efficient. When you've got a line out to the parking lot, you gotta move orders. Once business had calmed, he chatted with some customers. As my wife and I were packing up to go, he checked on us and made sure our food was good. He offered boxes and refills too. The atmosphere here was perfect.\n\nI would highly recommend Dimo's, just make sure you know what you want ahead of time \ud83d\ude06 the old man isn't afraid to call you out.",

Everyone at work loved the donuts-- I got a mix of specialty and regular. The regular donuts had a crispy outside and soft inside. I will definitely be returning for more donuts and to try the breakfast sandwitch!",
