Very nice to see it uncrowned as when I normally go there it is on a football weekend when it is packed.   Who knew that Steve Breaston was a fan of pulled pork and that Bo’s burger was with fried onions on sourdough rye bread.  Very nice lunch spot and great stuff on the walls.",

I was nervous at first as I always am with restaurants that have a large selection of dishes, but you would think that each item on the menu is their specialty with how good it was. Loved the atmosphere, too.",

It wasn’t bad but I felt it wasn’t as good as what I paid for particularly (ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and my significant other ordered Pesto Chicken Sandwich).",
