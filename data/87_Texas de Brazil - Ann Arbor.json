Our server was incredibly kind, patient, and attentive - we\nthink his name was Ivan? He was just a delight! And even repeated the dessert menu 3 different times. The salad bar was well maintained and everything was fresh and tasty, the lobster bisque was on point yesterday. The meats circulated regularly, only disappointment was that this location does lamb chops as a la crate, so just be aware of this is something such enjoy. My husband likes all the lamb offerings and was more than satisfied with the lamb shank and the lamb picana, so didn’t really miss the lamb chops at all! Overall, it was a great night and we thank this location for giving our family such a great experience!",

They have so many different choices. Enough to satisfy just about every taste. The meat selection was great as well, although, towards the end, they only brought around the same 3 meats. The atmosphere is very nice as well. The place is very nicely decorated. If you leave this place hungry, it's your own fault. We were all ready to burst when we left. The prices are high, but it's well worth it, for all of the different things that you can try. 5 stars for sure!",

The hot bar was great. The lobster bisque. Yummm. The meats were coming out faster than we could eat. The bacon wrapped chicken, beef picanha and the sausage were my favorites. Anything and as much as you want. I had to turn my card to red to catch up. The only thing I was missing in the meats would be some shrimp or some seafood or fish option. There was shrimp on the bar. The pineapples on the salad bar maybe one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. I would recommend this anytime. We will definitely be coming back.",

                "description": "While the restaurant makes an effort, it simply doesn't compare to a traditional Brazilian steakhouse. The buffet offerings were average, and many of the meat options had an unusual texture that affected the overall taste. Given the price point, I expected better quality; there are definitely better steak options in the region.\nOn the positive side, the ambiance of the place was nice, and our waitstaff were attentive and helpful. However, we did encounter some issues with our reservation—the receptionist seemed confused, and to top it off, we later received an email indicating that we hadn’t attended our reservation.",

                "description": "This is a meat lovers Paradise 😍😍!! It is a buffet style restaurant where you go up to the salad bar to get most of your sides and salad. You have a meat card they give you with a green side and a red side, you flip it to green when you want meat to be brought to the table. The red side is for no meat for the time being and you can always say no thank you even if they come up. They have people bring you a wide range of meats to your table and you can take as much or as little as you want.\n\nThe drinks were amazing, come when they first open for happy hour and it's basically BOGO. I went for my birthday 🎂 and got a free dessert which was amazing!! DEFINITELY bring your appetite to this place to get your money's worth because it is around 50 bucks per person to have access to everything! Everyone was super friendly and our server was great!! I recommend making a reservation, it gets crowded quick. I will continue going to this restaurant as long as they keep making it like this!!",

Melon, watermelon, dragon fruit,  blue berries, and blue cheeses, eggplant and many other items missing.          If this is franchise and price is same, why many items missing?\nWe asked waiter that we are here to celebrate Birth Day. Any thing for on the house? he said you should have said when reserving so we could prepare cake.   we reserved same day and no one asked what is the occasion.  Interesting response and insulting",
