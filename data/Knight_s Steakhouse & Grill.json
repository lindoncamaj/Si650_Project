My personal favorites are the spicy chicken sandwich and the onion rings. Also recently tried the pork chops on special with caramel sauce and they were cooked perfectly. The only dish we didn't care for was the meatloaf, but may have been due to our preference of taste and texture. I need to save room for dessert next time because it looks amazing.",

Had to finally approach her to get any attention (restaurant was EXTREMELY busy, and she was doing double duty, wrapping silverware with her back to her host station).\n\nFood was good; not great. Their table bread appears to be a high-hydration Italian - it was tasty and had FANTASTIC gluten development, but was baked in too hot an oven, leaving a nice browned, chewy crust, but leaving the crumb a bit doughy. Seasonings on the bread were nice. Dinner salads were unremarkable. The vegetables served with our steaks were way overcooked, and my baked potato had been held a bit long based on its interior color and texture. My wife’s potato was not held as long and had a nice, fluffy white interior. My steak, ordered rare, was received medium rare (very common), but was nicely seasoned and buttery-tender, so I did not turn it back (rarely do, anyway). My wife’s steak was ordered and received medium. Her steak was nowhere near as tender as mine - a bit tougher than the higher degree of doneness would justify.\n\nMy wife’s Riesling was unpalatable - not a very good Riesling at all - avoid. My Guinness was as Guinness generally is: good! The hot fudge cream puff for dessert was delightful.\n\nLisa, our server was personable and attentive. Service was slower than one would have hoped for at a restaurant at this price point (moderate), but it was a Friday night, but they were clearly being hammered. Reservations are definitely recommended!\n\nWe’ll try it again midweek when they may not be so busy.",

                "description": "We recently visited what used to be our favorite restaurant in Jackson, and we are sad to report a significant decline in both customer service and food quality.\n\nThe shrimp scampi, priced at a hefty $24, came with a mere five shrimp and maybe 50 cents worth of pasta. This was a shocking disappointment considering the price. The drinks, which were previously a highlight of our visits, have noticeably shrunk in size and no longer offer the generous “knight’s pour” we once enjoyed.\n\nOur waitress, Dana, was inattentive and seemed indifferent to our dining experience. She removed an entire plate of pasta without even asking if everything was alright. To add to the frustration, she brought the bill without providing a pen to sign.\n\nOverall, this visit was a huge disappointment, especially considering this used to be our favorite spot in Jackson. I hope they can turn things around, but for now, I can't recommend it.\n\nWe would like add that the hostess, Paige, is always friendly and welcoming.  We also do appreciate the new paint and artwork to “modernize “ the restaurant.",
