The staff are friendly and welcoming, always making you feel at home. The patio is a great spot to relax, perfect for sunny mornings or cozy afternoons.

The overall atmosphere is inviting and fun. Definitely a spot I’d recommend to any coffee lover!\n\nThe Journal book Idea is such an awesome idea, brought a smile when I read some pages.",

Both drinks were great! The staff was very sweet as they entertained us even if we showed up when the shop was about to close in 10min(we were the last ones to place our order) but they did not make us feel so. The apple trees and extra seating on the side is nice but the apples are all infested and it would be ideal if it was taken care of but it was a good experience. I loved the old Remington typewriter they have kept next to the wait line, reminding us of simpler times.",

They have other alternative milk options as well.\n\nThe roast is delicious and even their vegan bakery items are moist and perfected.\n\nWe also tried the hot cocoa and a latte with oat milk and honey. They have banana bread and cookies and other assortment of goods/foods.\n\nThere's plenty of outdoor seating, so on a nice day you can enjoy the shade and the sun.\n\nIt's perfect for families. And there's plenty of parking on the street and behind the building.",
