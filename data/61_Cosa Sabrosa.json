                "description": "Kudos to the talented chefs behind the scenes for crafting the finest tacos in Ann Arbor. One suggestion: consider doubling up on the tortillas, as they tend to fall apart easily. We appreciated the grilled tortillas, as most places use them right out of the package without warming them up. The delicious guac, along with the flavorful elote and pickled veggies, was also a hit. The churros were also enjoyable. Although the horchata was tasty, it was sweeter than anticipated. We will certainly be back. Do keep in mind that the prices are higher than most places in town.",

Not only is it amazing but it is consistent the first day me and my wife got it. We had to go back the next day. And it was just as good. They have great vegetarian options and the staff is super friendly. I also love the periodical music that's live in the next room. Whether to go or in-house with a beer, you cannot go wrong. I've lived here my whole life and I've never tasted Latin food this good. Why are you still reading this? You should be ordering online right now. Go trust me. Thank me later",

Be prepared for an isolated ordering interface bereft of any person-on-person interaction. Be ready for the partially-smooth iPad user interface. Be ready for the unattached dining which seems to only be offered outside. Be ready for an unpredictable wait time. However, if you\u2019re not a complete utter intolerant imbecile, you\u2019ll sacrifice a bit of convenience for the absolute paradise of food which awaits. We ordered a plethora of items: the Elote, Birria Quesadilla, Steak Tacos, Beans, Rice and to finish it all off, Churros. I\u2019m going to spare the reader the details but what words I have for each item could fill multiple pages. An eatery of elation.\n\nI implore you to check it out. To miss out on such deliciousness would be criminal.",
