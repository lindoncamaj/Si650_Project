The service is always impeccable, staff are extremely knowledgeable and always accommodating. Itâ€™s a speakeasy vibe with a modern twist. The house band plays on Thursday and is a must if you havenâ€™t been in. I recommend booking a reservation on busier nights, if not thatâ€™s okay because they always are super good about getting tables seated quickly and fitting people in. The Last Word is definitely top notch. Check them out if you havenâ€™t already. ðŸ¥‚",
