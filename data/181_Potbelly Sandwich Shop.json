My last transaction there was Saturday June 15th, which is still processing in my bank account. Today at 1:06 PM I got a charge from a Potbelly in Chicago, IL. I called the Ann Arbor location before I knew it came from Chicago and spoke with their manager Matt, who said there was no history of that transaction at their location.  I finally called my bank and they did confirm the location was indeed in Chicago and did confirm that my card was indeed compromised at the Ann Arbor location considering it is the only Potbelly I have ever visited (which shows in my recent history). Please be careful using your card at their machines or using it there in general because I have only visited a couple times and now my credit card information was stolen by someone.",

                "description": "Hi, I just ordered a chicken salad sandwich today with extra toppings of lettuce, light mayo, and seasoning. I had my order delivered and it was unopened when I got it, so it was not tampered with after being bought. Upon opening the sandwich right out of the bag, there is ONLY lettuce and mayo, no chicken salad. I paid for much more than what I got. It is disgusting, a lettuce and mayo sandwich. Is there a way I can get a partial refund or something?\n\nI have had past good experiences with potbellys so naturally I'm very disappointed.\n\nI can not find another way to contact you about my wrong order so I'm doing it here. I dont think I've ever asked for a refund or pointed out a wrong order in my life because I know food service staff are so busy and stressed, but a lettuce sandwich is a bit worse than just giving me the wrong food item.\n\nThe shake was very good, and even the bread was good. I have had the chicken sandwich before so I knew what good thing I was missing. Thank you",
