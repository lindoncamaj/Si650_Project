I realize they just opened but their service and care is incredibly lacking. The place is FILTHY and it just opened a few weeks ago. There was food spilled everywhere and no one seems to care. In addition, they still don't offer all of their products so I just ordered chips and queso.... I don't mean to sound stingy but this cup is not even close to filled up. I hope they can figure it out because I was very excited about having QDoba in the Michigan Union and as of right now I can never go back to this particular location. I would much rather walk two blocks down the street to Chipotle.",

Yelling and arguing with each other (both times I visited) and skimping on food - big time. Ordered a steak bowl both times and each time she filled a spoon with steak, leveled it and dumped out half back into the container.  The bowl had hardly anything in it for $13.  It will be a short walk, but I'll be going to Chipotle from now on.",

I ventured into this establishment with high hopes, having ordered a bowl of deliciousness.\n\nPicture this: I'm savoring every bite, reveling in the flavors, when suddenly, a produce sticker makes an unexpected cameo on one of my peppers! Yes, my dear reader, I couldn't help but wonder if I had stumbled into a culinary version of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, only with a produce twist.\n\nSummoning my courage, I marched back to the cashier, sticker in hand, and showed him the star of the show. The staff promptly took center stage, recreating my order. It was like a live-action performance, and I was the honored audience member.\n\nEagerly, I returned to my apartment, ready to give the meal another whirl. This time, as I indulged, I felt a peculiar sensation in my mouth. Lo and behold, it was a hair that decided to join the dinner party! It was as though the universe conspired to turn my meal into a culinary circus act.\n\nWhile I appreciate the establishment's commitment to providing surprise entertainment, I must confess that I came for a meal, not a magic show. Alas, I left with my taste buds bewildered and my sense of adventure fully satisfied. In the end, this dining experience was more eventful than a rollercoaster ride – a real hair-raising experience, you might say!\n\n1 out of 5.",
