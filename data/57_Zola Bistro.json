Her omelet was not impressive, before ordering,  she asked the waitress if she could exclude Bell peppers, and she told her unfortunately no, the peppers and onions were already put together. When we received our meals, potatoes were both cold and seemed like they had nothing but peppers in her omelets. My omelet was lacking cheese and was rather disappointed with the flavor. For $22.00 for each omelet I was expecting something grand, it was not anything to get excited about. Service was not great, waited over 10 minutes before we got our menus, Ten more minutes before getting water's. I would not go back again. Way overpriced for quality of food.",

Recently there were problems with a carryout order that I received.  Because I value this business in our community, I decided to call and speak to management. Hedia, who I believe is the owner, spoke with me. She expressed gratitude for me calling, she was extraordinarily generous in her compensation for the mistakes. Every business has problem days or problem employees or problem products. But only some of the best businesses take quality assurance so seriously. We are lucky to have such a high quality business in Ann Arbor.",
