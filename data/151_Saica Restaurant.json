                "description": "Walking in, the atmosphere was comfortable but the dining area was outdated and a bit dusty. I ordered the Curry Chicken Katsu for $18. A lot of rice and sauce, but not much chicken. The veggies were very soft to the point of mushy, and the curry was just okay. I might come back to try the sushi, but I will not have my hopes up.",

They combine orders on the same plate / package multiple orders with no regard to the fact that some patrons have allergies or dietary restrictions that need to be honored. And when you approach them about the need for separate orders to be plated / packaged separately, they stutter, stammer, and do nothing- no apologies, no offer to remake or correct their mistake, and no return credit either. Horrible customer service and disgusting food preparation & service.",

With a main dish you receive a delicious bowl of miso soup with tofu. It is well balanced and refreshing, even on a hot day. The chuka salad is also light and fresh. The star here is their curry. I had the katsu curry don which was incredible. It was perfectly cooked and the portion is generous. Once again everything was balanced. Truly a great experience, thank you.",
