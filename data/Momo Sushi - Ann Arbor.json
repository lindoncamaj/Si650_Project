Ordered a plethora of rolls and they came out by 4:35 pm. Perfect place. The food is prepared fresh here. Everything is made to perfection. Unbelievable place for sushi. Even the appetizers didn't taste like they came from a box. Maybe they just have a better fryer than most. Servers checked on us at 4:38 for refills. My cup was never empty. The place was not too full on this Sunday afternoon.",

I picked up my order this time, but if you're dining at the restaurant, I would definitely recommend getting the firecracker appetizer (think sushi jalapeño popper) and a kettle of one of their teas. Honestly, I cannot recommend Momo's enough.",

The staff was friendly and the service was good.\n\nWe started out with an order of pork gyoza, which came out quickly. They were hot and crispy, but a little underwhelming. For dinner, we were intrigued by the \"sushi burritos\" on the menu. We love sushi and poke bowls, but have never tried anything like that. When we asked what the difference was, our server said they are the same, but the burritos are larger. The Fireball Burrito was actually a dollar cheaper than the Fireball Sushi Roll, so I gave it a try. It was tasty, but I think I'd go with the sushi roll next time as it just didn't feel like sushi eating it like that. I think I prefer the bite-size pieces and the crunch lost its crunch when mixed in like it was. My husband tried the Dragon Burrito and he enjoyed it, but felt eating it burrito-style was definitely messier!\n\nOverall, we felt like the food was good and the prices were reasonable. This is a casual and quick place to go for some fairly priced sushi (and sushi-like) dishes.",
