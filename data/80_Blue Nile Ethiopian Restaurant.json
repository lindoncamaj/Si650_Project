                "description": "This was my second visit to Blue Nile Restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan, an Ethiopian eatery. I love it because they offer gluten-free bread made from teff flour. The all-you-can-eat vegetarian feast and the spiced Ethiopian tea, which is naturally sweet, are both delightful. The ambiance is inviting, and the decor transports you beyond the U.S. The staff frequently checks in to see if you need more food. The dishes are flavorful and satisfying without feeling heavy afterward. I also enjoy eating with my fingers and the bread, and the communal vibe reminds me of home in the Philippines. I’d rate this place a 10 out of 10 for its food taste and ambiance. However, there is a $3 charge each time you order more gluten-free bread.",

We tried the bread pudding and lemon sorbet, both were delicious!! A great place for a group to share from a plate!!",

They have a mandatory policy of ordering a vegetable tray for $22, which I found quite steep. Unfortunately, the taste of the vegetable tray did not meet my expectations. Additionally, I was surprised to learn that if I wanted to add any meat dish, I would have to order another vegetable tray. This policy feels excessive and takes away from the overall dining experience. I hope they reconsider their approach, as it detracts from what could be a great meal.",

You begin your meal with a steamy hot towel to cleanse your hands.\nYou will not be disappointed waitresses are dressed in authentic clothing are knowledgeable and helpful with choosing dishes. We always up for the vegetarian platter with lamb and chicken on the side it is a small portion but it’s definitely a delicacy to have meat. Extremely tender and well seasoned. Vegetarian platter is all you can eat. Healthy fulfilling meal and fun to eat with hands! Also try their home brewed tea it’s refreshing.",

                "description": "This was an interesting experience.  A couple things of which one might want to be aware:  this is basically a set menu, meaning you get the Vegetarian Feast and that's your option.  You can add meat dishes (just a few choices) a la carte, but only if you get the whole feast; they are add-on only.  We had the spicy beef and chicken.  The chicken was just three tiny drumsticks but quite tender and tasty but really just an appetizer.  The beef was more like a meal addition.\n\nThe service was pleasant, but even though there was hardly anyone there, the servers weren't keeping up so great.\n\nAlso, don't plan on bringing leftovers home.  You can take leftover meat dishes and bread, but not the vegetarian dishes.  Now, you can order or replenish the tray as much as you like but you can't take leftovers.  We had four people, replenished it once and were full.  We ate about 80 percent of the second one (which I think amply justified ordering the second tray, we weren't trying to cheat) and then had to watch them throw away the nice food we just couldn't eat.  In this world of waste and inefficiency, it was very sad to watch.  It definitely left me feeling sad as we left the restaurant.",

                "description": "I love the communal vibe that comes from sharing the vegetarian feast (at meat dishes, which you can order along with the feast). The service and food at Blue Nile are consistently excellent, whether with a group of 3 or party of 12. I also like that they don't bring silverware to the table (though maybe they would if you ask). There is an expectation that everyone can simply eat with the bread as intended rather than pandering to the American comfort zone. That seems respectful to me, like expecting competence. Also, they give you hot moist hand towels before and after the meal, which I find delightful.",
