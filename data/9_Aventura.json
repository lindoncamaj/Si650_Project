So, let's dive right in!\nNow, I'm not sure if you've heard, but Ann Arbor is a fantastic place for foodies like us. One of the best spots we've discovered is this incredible restaurant that serves up healthy, nutritional, and absolutely delicious food and beverages.\nI'll admit, I was a little hesitant at first. You see, I've had some not-so-great experiences with parking in Ann Arbor. But I'm here to tell you that it's totally worth it! I would battle the hell of parking in Ann Arbor every day just to eat here.\nNow, let me tell you about my first visit to this restaurant. I was a bit nervous, as it was my first time there, but the ladies working the counter were absolutely amazing. They were so sweet and helpful, and it really made my experience that much better. I'm definitely going to be returning to this place, and I'm so excited to try even more of their delicious menu items.\nI have to say, this place is just great! It's always clean, the service is timely and kind, and I recently had the chance to try their amazing Smoothies. I went in fairly close to closing time, but I was still greeted with kindness and a perfectly made Smoothie.\nAnd let me tell you, their menu is a foodie's dream. They have a variety of fresh fruit and nuts, and I'm already planning my next visit to try even more of their tasty treats.\nSo, there you have it, folks! Our latest adventure in Ann Arbor. I can't wait to share more of our experiences with you, and I hope you're as excited as we are to explore this amazing city.\nThank you so much for joining us today, and if you enjoyed this video, please don't forget to like, share, and subscribe. Until next time, keep exploring and enjoying the adventure!",

The staff was extremely kind in helping with our dietary restrictions and everything we ended up eating was delicious. Tapas style means you get to try a bunch of fun things too! We also had the paella and had plenty leftover even though three of us were eating it. Definitely don't miss this spot if you're in Ann Arbor! (Pictures are patatas bravas, bacon wrapped dates, and chicken paella)",

We also got the classic paella and Brussels sprouts. If you're looking to sit outside on a nice night, their back patio is really cute. This is also a perfect place for large groups. They're very accommodating for large parties and you can get a ton of tapas for everyone to be able to try a variety of items. Looking forward to my next visit!",
