It's the same couple running this place with same tables and chairs that I am familiar with, but the service from the lady (the boss) got so much worse. Also, she added tip charge to my receipt without telling me about it at all. This is illegal practice and I was just by myself. The food also got more expensive for LESSER quality, but I wasn't expecting the best food in town to begin with and it never was. I saw both the husband and the wife that day and they both appeared impatient, stressed, and certainly don't enjoy their jobs or the customers there. Years ago, they used to be much nicer and even had some fun chats with customers from time to time. Not anymore. I guess it pains to approach retirement age and realize there isn't enough in the bank account, and the pandemic must have hit them hard. I did not have a good experience yesterday and have no reason to re-visit this place again, but wish them well.",

The wide, flat noodles, cooked to perfection, offer a silky canvas for the succulently stir-fried beef that's seasoned just right. Each bite is a harmonious blend of savory and slightly smoky flavors.\n\nMoving on to the Scallion Pancakes \u2013 these are a revelation. Crispy on the outside, yet wonderfully soft and chewy inside, these pancakes are infused with the perfect amount of scallions. Each bite delivers a satisfying crunch, followed by the delightful oniony flavor that's not overpowering but pleasantly subtle.",

                "description": "If you order right menu this place will be definitely the best Chinese restaurant in the town and perhaps in the whole state.
