The service here is excellent and you feel like you are always well taken care of. We ordered dishes to share and we loved all of them. The winner was the beet salad. We also had Brussels sprouts, lots of French Fries, which I love there, bang bang shrimp, and split a cheeseburger. Great burgers. Great cocktails. Our server was awesome even with it being really busy that night.",

Food was extremely tasty; had the Lemon Zaâ€™atar Fish and Chips, Fish Tacos, and the Little Gem Lettuce salad. The salad sauce was a very nice addition. Same for the tacosâ€™ sauce. Nice location of the restaurant on State Street as well. Service was great, Madison was our server and she was quick and courteous. I highly recommend Savaâ€™s for anyone in A2 and hope to come back!",

                "description": "Service was great! Server was knowledgeable about gluten allergy concerns they walked me through the menu and the appropriate things that could be substituted so I could make a decision. There was more than just salad options. And they even had a dedicated fryer for French fries! I got a side of fries with my chicken and did not have any adverse reactions. I'd recommend when you make a reservation that you indicate any allergies they need to be aware of so they can be prepared and begin with that in mind. I would recommend them! Also it's not explicitly fancy, but definitely a snappy casual or higher kind of place. Plan accordingly!",

Highly recommend the Brunch buffet deal (especially for kids)  The food is so high quality with options like Jumbo shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon, pasta, eggs, and desserts! We also ordered Al a Carte for a couple dishes.yummy!!!  Presentation was so nice! The portions were quite large, so keep that in mindâ€¦we wished we sharedâ€¦ We will definitely be back, when passing through again. Highly recommend this place!!! I found this on Google! So glad I did!",
