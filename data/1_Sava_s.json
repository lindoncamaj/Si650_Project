The service here is excellent and you feel like you are always well taken care of. We ordered dishes to share and we loved all of them. The winner was the beet salad. We also had Brussels sprouts, lots of French Fries, which I love there, bang bang shrimp, and split a cheeseburger. Great burgers. Great cocktails. Our server was awesome even with it being really busy that night.",

Food was extremely tasty; had the Lemon Za\u2019atar Fish and Chips, Fish Tacos, and the Little Gem Lettuce salad. The salad sauce was a very nice addition. Same for the tacos\u2019 sauce. Nice location of the restaurant on State Street as well. Service was great, Madison was our server and she was quick and courteous. I highly recommend Sava\u2019s for anyone in A2 and hope to come back!",

Server was knowledgeable about gluten allergy concerns they walked me through the menu and the appropriate things that could be substituted so I could make a decision. There was more than just salad options. And they even had a dedicated fryer for French fries! I got a side of fries with my chicken and did not have any adverse reactions. I'd recommend when you make a reservation that you indicate any allergies they need to be aware of so they can be prepared and begin with that in mind. I would recommend them! Also it's not explicitly fancy, but definitely a snappy casual or higher kind of place. Plan accordingly!",
