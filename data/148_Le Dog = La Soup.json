Bavarian potato, broth chock full of sausage, potatoes, and mixed vegetables... don't forget to order the bread to go with it! Then if you still have room, have a hot dog or sausage with some sauerkraut!\n\n2022\nFrom the original stall back to my campus days to the little spot in downtown Ann Arbor, Le Dog is another iconic spot that locals love! Freshly made soups each day, with lobster bisque (my personal fave) additionally offered on Thursdays and Fridays. Hot dog and polish sausage round out the menu!\n\nChicken tortilla is the family fave! Tried the salmon shrimp corn chowder today too ... light in flavor, not too salty. Zingerman's bread was great to soak up with the soup!",

I love salt so I was alright with it but I wouldn't recommend it to someone with sodium issues.\nOverall not bad and a more affordable lunch spot for Ann Arbor.",
