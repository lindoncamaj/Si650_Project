                "description": "I ordered the Traditional Red Hawk Burger with Steak Fries and the Sweet Potato Fries. The burger came out exactly like I wanted, medium rare. It was tasty and the toppings were fresh. The steak fries weren't anything special but the sweet potato fries had a perfect crisp and paired very well with the chipotle-mayo. I also had the paloma drink here and the flavors didn't pop as much as I wanted it to but, still refreshing nonetheless. Overall experience was great and our waitress Elena was very nice.",

I ended up getting the Smoked Turkey Rueben which was so good and something I\u2019ll definitely come back for. Their hand cut fries are also very good and I would recommend getting them with your meal. Price wise they are very fair as my sandwich with a side ended up being about fourteen dollars. Stop by and give them a try!",

The combination of authenticity, simplicity and savoir-faire in this dish made me fall off my chair. The quality and freshness of the ingredients splashed off the plate and the masterful preparation - brilliant in its simplicity - did the rest. Not only delicious, but also healthy and satiating. Anyone looking for unadulterated quality without fuss, at a fair price in pleasant surroundings, knows where to go.",
