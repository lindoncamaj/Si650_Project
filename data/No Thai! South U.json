They donâ€™t seem super enthusiastic about their job but they arenâ€™t rude or off putting in any way. No Thai is a good once a week lunch for me since itâ€™s really expensive now. I remember when a Pad Thai Curry and spring rolls was under $15. Now itâ€™s $20+ and they throw that tip request at you when paying by card. Hopefully their quality and consistency gets a little better someday but itâ€™s been this way for years so Iâ€™m not expecting that to really ever happen.",
