I loved their bread which comes at every meal. Servers come promptly to give you more bread once you are out. I ordered a lobster gnocchi and it was divine! The sauce flavorful and the gnocchi was perfect. I had the French onion soup. I wanted to be open-minded, but I'm just not a French onion person. Lol. I think I'd try the Maine  lobster bisque next time, as well as the beef wellington. Looking forward to another special event for me to go there again. ðŸ˜Š",

Got an aggatto for dessert, which was delicious!  Ask for a wet towel.  They will come put with a lemon and towel bowl hand wash for you!

The filet mingon here is my personal favorite thing to order here and if you order it make sure to get the cognac peppercorn sauce it taste the best. I also carved out a piece of the steak to make it look like a heart!",

                "description": "Nestled on Main Street in Ann Arbor, The Chop House offers a pinnacle of fine dining experiences. As with many smaller cities, parking can be a challenge, so it's advisable to seek out the nearby structure, just a block away, to ensure a hassle-free arrival.\n\nUpon entering, the restaurant's grandeur becomes immediately apparent, with its expansive layout and a sophisticated cigar lounge nestled in the lower level. The establishment boasts ample space, including sizable rooms in the lower level suitable for hosting events.\n\nDuring our visit on a serene Tuesday evening, despite having made reservations, the bustling ambiance made it evident that they weren't necessary. Opting to forgo starters, we delved straight into our entrÃ©es. Each dish, whether it was the sumptuous salmon or the delectable beef selection, impressed with its quality and flavor.\n\nService was impeccable, exemplified by the synchronized arrival of our meals, each attended to by a dedicated server. The extensive wine selection complemented the meal perfectly, and the elegance of the white tablecloths added an extra touch of refinement to the dining experience.\n\nThe side dishes, particularly the potatoes, proved to be indulgent delights, with a single serving easily satisfying the entire party. For groups of four, it's advisable to limit side orders to no more than two, especially if foregoing starters.\n\nThough tempted by dessert, we found ourselves pleasantly satiated from the generous portions and flavorsome dishes, making it an optional addition. Departing with contented palates and full stomachs, the consensus was unanimousâ€”a visit to The Chop House is an experience worth savoring.\n\nWhile the bill may reflect the upscale nature of the establishment, our $400 expenditure before gratuity was deemed well worth it for the exceptional quality of food and service received. For those seeking an unparalleled fine dining experience in Ann Arbor, I wholeheartedly recommend The Chop House!",

                "description": "Make no mistake about it. This is the real deal. There are world-class restaurants in every big city, mostly on the East and West Coast (and Vegas). But you rarely find a place this excellent in a small city like Ann Arbor... no matter how sophisticated it might be. The Chop House is one of those restaurants. From its complete and interesting wine list to its clever desserts the careful attention to the little things separates this place from the rest. Like, when was the last time you were able to check your coat? It isn't cheap but I have rarely gotten more value for the money. If you want superb service and an excellent meal this is the place to come.",
