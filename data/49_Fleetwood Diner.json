The food is pretty much your classic diner food and it\u2019s nice that you can get breakfast, lunch, or dinner food any time. After a late night in Ann Arbor, it\u2019s a solid place to go to for a late night meal. I feel like it\u2019s a place that in reality is fine, but, it\u2019ll always seem incredible because whenever you go, it\u2019s probably super late after a night out and it just hits differently lol",

Fleetwood Diner is best known for its Hippie Hashbrowns but almost anything on the menu is good! A very popular place, getting in to actually dine can be tricky, so I recommend getting your order to go. Parking is also challenging, but don't get discouraged, something will open up, even if you end up walking it's worth it! Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is hot, fresh and well prepared!",

                "description": "My friend and I used to love this place. We would drive 45 minutes just to order their \"Hippie Hash.\"\nSo disappointed.\nWhile eating, the cook LOUDLY complained to a coworker about personal issues. This went on for a good 15 minutes before my friend had to ask him to stop with his vulgarity. There's more, but why bother. Sadly, we won't be back.\nGood luck in the bathroom. No soap, and it stinks of sewer.\n*Side note, my friend wrote her review and added pictures of the diner. However, they took them down. Odd.\nReposting them.\nIf you can't see them, they again deleted them.",

It has all you want for dinner vibes, good graffiti, stickers, greasy food, barstools, etc. When I went for brunch it was great I really enjoyed my meal and the outdoor patio seating was nice under the roof part. Going at night is an entirely different experience haha. I'd say the place is great for a diner but the service is a little slow. I think part of that is because it's always full and there wait staff and cooks are stretched a bit thin. This is just a fair warning that if the place is busy, the meal won't be as quick.",
