Bao buns here are always great, soft, fluffy and just the right texture, I have never gotten a bad bun. They have several boa buns that can be picked with their options of meats, masubi, bowls and even fries. Everything is made to order so it will take a little bit of time especially if theres a lot of people here. Ahh, I forgot to mention this isn’t a standard restaurant facility but more like a food truck. But the parking isn’t too bad and it’s free. Everything that I’ve tried so far has been delightful and steaming with flavor. I’m sure you won’t be able to buy just one bun, try them all. They even have a vegetarian option with mushroom and that was pretty good as well. I’m seen this place slightly busy to full on get in line now busy. I think it can be worth the wait and if you want to hang around, there are plenty of seats situated outside.",
