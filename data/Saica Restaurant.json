They combine orders on the same plate / package multiple orders with no regard to the fact that some patrons have allergies or dietary restrictions that need to be honored. And when you approach them about the need for separate orders to be plated / packaged separately, they stutter, stammer, and do nothing- no apologies, no offer to remake or correct their mistake, and no return credit either.

With a main dish you receive a delicious bowl of miso soup with tofu. It is well balanced and refreshing, even on a hot day. The chuka salad is also light and fresh. The star here is their curry. I had the katsu curry don which was incredible. It was perfectly cooked and the portion is generous. Once again everything was balanced. Truly a great experience, thank you.",
