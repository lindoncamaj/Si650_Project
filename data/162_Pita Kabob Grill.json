Its location was super convenient, but it's easy to see how you could miss it if you weren't looking for it!\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the experience was great, the staff was very chill, patient and helpful as we tried to make our selections from their menu. They've got a very diverse menu and there's something for basically everyone. Among my friend group we had people who were Vegan and people who were on Low Carb diets and we all found things to eat pretty easily.\n\nThere's not a ton of indoor seating as the restaurant is pretty small, but it's adequate for what it is, and there are a couple of tables with chairs outside. Once you've ordered, the food arrives fairly quickly too. Overall the food tastes great, it's a good value, and it's close to campus!\n\nLow Carb/ Keto folks: There are tons of options for you here, but they are rice heavy, so ask for a substitute or get a larger dish to compensate. Personally I ordered the Mixed Kabob plate, and it was plenty of food especially since you can get a soup or salad as a side (Be forewarned, the Chicken Curry soup has rice in it!!)",

Chicken shawarma never comes with potatoes anywhere I've been.  Great way to serve half the chicken with cheap potatoes.\n\nThe entire meal is $6.99-$8.99 anywhere else at ten times the quality.  I ended up at $20 for a horrible dinner with a drink.    Shameful that was served honestly.     What's you see in my picture was $10..         very unhappy but everyone else ordering seemed ok.

I ordered delivery online and it was SO incredibly simple. It was through the Slice delivery service and actually my first time ordering food for delivery. (I never treat myself like that). While ordering I thought the prices were fair, once I received my order — they were more than fair! The pita wraps for example are like 2 meals! & I don’t know if I just happened to pick the best menu choices or if everything is so delicious, but wow! I ordered the Shawarma Chicken Feta Wrap, the cold yogurt cucumber soup, the spinach pies, pita & hummus and the Mojadara side and it was all delicious. & I have leftovers to enjoy it all again tomorrow, yippie! I’m glad to have learned about such a great place (thanks Google maps!) and my delivery driver was the nicest! (& was wearing a mask). Thank you!! I’d give 10 stars if I could.",
