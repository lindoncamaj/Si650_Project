I was down today after I ordered from a completely DIFFERENT separate Jets that didn't honor what they said they would regarding my vegetarian diet restrictions. I was worried I wouldn't be able to eat Jets again, but luckily I called this location, and the woman I spoke with was so nice and understanding. She sympathized with my situation immediately, and assured me that diet restrictions like vegetarianism and veganism are something they take very seriously, and that they have a lot of vegetarian and vegan clients, and it's just something that I could tell was important to them. I really wish I'd gotten her name, I spoke with her about 45 minutes ago, she was so great, and we are definitely switching to this Jets! The pizza came so quickly too, and was so tasty!!!",

One of their delivery cars broke down so everything got backed up over an hour and our pizza was cold when it arrived. I was upset. I called and they immediately zeroed out the charges, no questions asked.   Later, the owner texted me directly to apologize and explain what happened -- and he automatically added a discount to our next order. I was so impressed with Joe's thoughtfulness and personal outreach and tried to pay retroactively-- he wouldn't let me. I also tipped the driver.  My hope is that, going forward, we can all have a bit of grace - myself included- especially for small businesses. p.s.  We popped the cold pizza into a toaster oven and it was as good as new.",
