Will occasionally have dinner and its always excellent.  Most recently had the pasta with a short rib meat sauce.  Followed by one of the best chocolate mousses I\u2019ve had in a long time.

We rented out the whole lower level for our 50 person wedding reception. I would not recommend this venue if you had anymore than 50 people as it is an intimate space. The food was delicious and we received so many compliments! As for parking, we happened to get married the same day as a home football game but didn't have any issues with parking in the street and nearby lots. All communication is through an online portal and our coordinator was very responsive.",

The Matzo Ball Gumbo had an intrusive flavor and was overall okay. The Fatoosh was just a regular salad, nothing crazy. The Braised American Lamb had an extremely strong lamb aroma but had amazing texture. The desserts carried the meal fasho.",
