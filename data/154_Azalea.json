The small plates were delicious and I enjoyed the cauliflower, crispy rice, and tuna dishes. Try the Azalea role, as well. The vibe is very modern and moody with dim lighting and elegant touches down to the plating and cutlery. The place is a bit hidden and hard to find \u2013 look for the glass door next to Blue Llama and head down the stairs.",

Reminds me of stuff you would find in New York, especially with how they plate it. Cool and relaxed decor that\u2019s definitely perfect for a date night or if you wanna slip in for one of their unique drinks. Do yourself a favor and get something off the small plates portion of the menu. There is not a single miss here!

                "description": "We started off with their house cocktails, I ordered the Spring Azalea which was yumyum, I could have drank 4-5 of them. The Midori Mojito was also very nice, not too sweet. We ordered the verde cauliflower dish which was colorful and the sauce was delicious. The fried chicken was seasoned well, juicy, a bit on the oily side and it came with the spicy chilli oil sauce and we got to test the garlic soy sauce which we both preferred. The best and most unique dish was their winter salad which had a great variety of veggies and citrus and an amazing dressing which had fresh squeezed OJ, mustard (i think), savory and sweet complimenting the subtle bitter winter veg. I thought it was on par with a Spencer salad. The atmosphere seems in transition, like between a nightclub and restaurant with some kitschy aspects like the fake flowers outside and bedazzled buddha. On my way to the bathroom there were old arcade games in the hallways and random stuff. It is not an upscale dining experience but the drinks and food are very enjoyable and the staff are friendly and casual. We'll be back to try more drinks and food.",
