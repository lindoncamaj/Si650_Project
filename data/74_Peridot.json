                "description": "Really pretty space and the service was friendly and efficient.\n\nVietnamese food is my comfort food so I should probably not eat Vietnamese-inspired food because I\u2019ll inevitably be disappointed. So take these opinions with that in mind. The atmosphere of this place is great and perfectly good food for when you want to eat something a little different but not toooooo different.\n\nThe meat on the banh mi bruschetta was tasty but the toast threw me off a little. The papaya salad was a little bland and could have used more beef jerky. The hiramasa and prosciutto was interesting. The Dover sole was tasty and I liked the anchovy dressing. Spare ribs were ok but the texture of the meat was strange like maybe it had been boiled when it should have been grilled.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the flan and fried rice, both disappointing in texture and way too sweet.\n\nUpdate: I returned and liked it better this time! I tried some things in the menu that weren\u2019t there last time and really enjoyed it. There were a LOT of prawns so definitely share. The beef dish was excellent. The cabbage could have been cooked a little longer. Overall, I recommend this place!",

From start to finish our server, Nick, showed an enthusiasm for the menu that made my sister and I really excited for the culinary journey we were about to embark on. We started with the mocktails, which were better than any cocktail I\u2019ve ever had. I had the Elixir and my sister had the black tea highball, both were incredible, but the black tea highball was one of the most well rounded drinks I\u2019ve ever had AND absolutely delicious. For food, we had the mushrooms, the chicken wings, the bok choy, and curried prawns. Everything was at least an 8/10. But the bok choy\u2026 That bok choy was life-changing! I have a feeling it\u2019s a dish that my sister and I will be talking about for years to come. Highly recommend checking out Peridot if you haven\u2019t yet, and absolutely getting the bok choy while it\u2019s on the menu!",

                "description": "My birthday dinner at Peridot was quite a disappointment. While I really enjoyed their crab fried rice in a previous visit, this time all five dishes we ordered were extremely salty.  For example, we found salt crystals on the pork belly dish that was already heavily seasoned by the sauce. I burned my tongue a few days before I went to Peridot, and the salty dishes made my burn a lot worse. We asked for less salt in the last dish, and it was marginally better, but still too salty. Nice cocktails at the bar, though.",

Fantastic new addition to downtown,elegant  decor, very friendly staff. The \"Ha Long Bay\" is the one that blew me away. The prices mostly are definitely on the high end, especially on the cocktail side, but it's worth a try for once.",

                "description": "The food itself tasted good and seems that the large plates change quite often. So what you get will vary depending on the current menu. We happen to have ordered the grilled seabream and steak which were both great. The cocktails were great as well. The waiter was really amazing and he was the one that helped us get a table in the end. He also was super helpful and attentive when we were deciding what to order.\n\nI read other reviews before writing my own; I saw that someone else had written the hostess was quite rude and I also want to bring attention to the rude behavior of the hostess.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I walked in asking for a table for 2 a little after 7pm the majority of the tables were available. The hostess told us that there were absolutely no tables available and refused to give us a table saying we would have to wait for a long time. However, my boyfriend saw that there were reservations open online on their website for every 15 minutes and explained this to the hostess as well.\n\nI understand that at some restaurants that some tables may look empty but are reserved however that wasn\u2019t the case today. An explanation from the hostess would\u2019ve been nice but all she said was that she didn\u2019t see any open table on her iPad. I had to ask to be put on a waitlist for the bar that she did not offer which is normally the case at every other busy restaurant I\u2019ve been to. It was simple to book a res for a table at 7:45 but it was strange that the waitress said there were no tables. The server came out and told us there was suddenly a table available.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are students but we are also Asian. I keep thinking we were being discriminated against but maybe the hostess assumed we would tip poorly- which we don\u2019t for good service and shouldn\u2019t be an excuse for her poor attitude. Whatever the case this experience left a bad taste in my mouth even before tasting the food. I\u2019m really disappointed\u2026 I hope that other people do not experience the same thing.",
