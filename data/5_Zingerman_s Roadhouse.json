The service was just as impressive!

Asked if the fries were Crispy fries  she said yes\nFries were cold and soggy   She immediately replaced them and didn’t come back again for another 20 minutes\nBurgers 🍔 were medium rare I would say a good vet could have revived it. My son also asked for medium well. His was even worse wish I had gotten a picture\nThe cloth napkins were greasy and the water tasted like fish\nThe server did offer to bring another hamburger but we have a two hour drive home and didn’t have the time to wait.  After having made the 2 hour drive for a doctors appointment at Mott’s children hospital\nDid Not offer to make an adjustment for the inconvenience\nDid not apologize  in fact acted quite off putting After asking for a box she took my plate without a word and boxed it herself. Which I really don’t care for people touching my food\nPlease find another place to dine. I have no idea 🤷‍♀️ how they have such a high rating",

                "description": "This place was next level in many levels. There were so many gluten free options I had a tough time choosing. The pimento mac and cheese (with bacon) was so creamy and delectable, you don't miss the gluten at all. The same can be said for the gluten free fried chicken.\n\nIt was apparent that the folks working there love this place, and are huge fans of the food. Lots of local, or specialized sourcing really shines through.",

The food is super yummy and the portions are huge. The prices are somewhat high. However, the quality of the food outweighs the price.\nThey have lots of Gluten Free/Friendly options on their menu.\nI highly recommend Zingerman's. I always take family and friends here who are visiting from out of town and they love it.",
