The whole space is like a small market! There's a bunch of outdoor rustic seating and multiple places to purchase food, drinks, and gifts.\n\nThe BBQ brisket was good by itself - tender and juicy - but the sauce was way too sweet for my liking. And there's too much sauce on the rice, but it's a very good flavor!\n\nI definitely recommend this place and we will be back.\n\nThe staff was so friendly!",

Fusion cooking has become very popular and some misses the mark by a mile....but Ricewood is on point. Both the rice and Asian flavors are done right....and the BBQ brisket and pork belly would hold up in Texas. Great concept and delivery. I'll look forward to going out of my way to get back here.",

House smoked meats laid on top of Ricewoods bed mixture of rice (scallions, tomatoes, soy sauce vinaigrette) with a choice of your meat. I also suggest choosing Mild heat over Spicy, becauseâ€¦ it is spicy. I ordered Pork belly deluxe rice bowl. The Bomb Deluxe (sesame cucumber, red cabbage slaw, house made Kim chi, chili crisp, and pickled red onions) is a choice of an add on. Did I mention that they make their own Kim chi!?!?!? Which is AMAZING! Their portions are HUGE! Definitely earning your buck$ for all the food you get. All in all eat the food.",
