The nice thing is you can have a classy atmosphere but choose a more/less expensive meal. For example, a pizza is about 14.99, which is relatively average pricing. You can opt for a fuller, more expensive meal as well. I recommend trying it out casually or for an occasion— but definitely make a reservation!",

I had the “Ravioli di Vitello alla Palio” (Veal stuffed 'half moon' ravioli with sauteed mushrooms, spinach & a creamy veal demi-glace sauce). I thought it was very good and that is coming from someone who grew up eating home made Italian food made by my family who are from Italy. Abigail our server was super friendly, and very prompt with making sure we had everything we needed. She even put a candle on my espresso cake, and brought me a shot of espresso too! It was a perfect Birthday! Thanks!",
