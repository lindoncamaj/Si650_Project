                "description": "Dalat Vietnamese Restaurant is worth a visit.  I have been here twice.  Each time I order the Phở tái nạm (Beef Noodles Soup).  So delicious.  Bean sprouts, lime, basil leaves and jalapeños served on a side plate to use as desired.\n\nPho tai nam is a  traditional Vietnamese beef-base rice noodles soup with medium well-done sliced beef, beef brisket topped with onions & cilantro.  They have many other dishes besides the noodle soups.  For lunch there are different specials as well such as Benito boxes. They offer sit down service or pick up.  The staff waits on you quickly.  If you pay with credit card there is a extra charge.  When paying in cash they will discount the bill given to you.\n4-23-2024 Stopped by again and decided to try something new. Bánh xèo.  It is a piece of pan-fried golden crispy crêpe filled with shrimp & chicken (or pork), mushrooms, beansprouts and onions. On the side they give you a sweet and sour sauce to use with it.  I never had this before but I am wondering if mine was over cooked.  It was very crispy and brown not golden.  On the internet when you look up this dish it looks yellow almost resembling an egg omelet in appearance.  It seemed like a very greasy dish.  I also got the Spring rolls.  My mistake to order to fried dishes together.  Way to much oil.  I won't try this again.  The Pho is way too good to get this dish.  I will try to included photos.",

Fresh ingredients, not overcooked, 5 minutes at lunch hour, not huge proportions. my bad for not noting the dish I ordered. Plenty of seating inside and a little spot around the corner if you want to eat outdoors. If I had any suggestion, it would be to order Medium or ask for more spice on to go order.",

I did not really liked their noodle(bun), but the broth had good enough spiciness and nicely balanced layers of different flavors. Their pho was also very authentic.

                "description": "This place turned out to be a solid stop. The Bánh xèo was the winner for me - it had amazing texture and was crisp, filled with flavorful and fresh ingredients. The fried egg rolls were also really good. It’s a great choice if you’re in the area and it was a much needed break from American foods that were pretty much the only thing on offer around the cabin we spent the summer at.",

Many vegetarian offerings. Service is always great. Family-run and they take pride in the restaurant. They have some lunch specials in person and sometimes through the clover online purchase app (linked to in their website).",
