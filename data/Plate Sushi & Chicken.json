Street parking was plentiful with tons of nearby shops to check out. We got a few rolls for the table- salmon on the beach, U of M and Tokoyo roll plus the chicken wings with soy garlic/honey butter.\n\nSushi was a hit- loved the flavors and was able to see the sushi chefs at work. 10/10. Pictures on the menu so it was easy to pick out what we liked. The chicken was flavorful and very crunchy. Would definitely order again!\n\nWe also had the house barley tea which tasted heavy like oats as well as the miso soup which was the best miso soup of my life. Definitely stop in!",

The interior of the restaurant was not only aesthetically pleasing but also quite comfortable, which was perfect for our group dining outing. The best part was that our food came out surprisingly fast!\n\nThe Beef Teriyaki Bento was a real treat. The teriyaki sauce was just the right balance of savory, not too sweet, and not too salty - it hit the spot perfectly. I’m already looking forward to my next visit, as I can’t wait to try all the other bento options on the menu. A great place for a delicious and satisfying meal! I had a fantastic experience at Plate Sushi and Chicken in Ann Arbor. I ordered the ‘Salmon on the Beach’ and the ‘Popcorn Chicken Bento.’ The meal started with a pleasant surprise - cucumber and crab for the appetizer, along with a bowl of miso soup before the main course. The portion size was generous, so I had leftovers for dinner, which was a bonus. The sauces were delicious, and the shumai was quite tasty. I’m looking forward to returning for another delightful meal!",
