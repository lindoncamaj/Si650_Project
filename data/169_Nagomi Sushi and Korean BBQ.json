I particularly liked the cleanliness of their place along with the service.\nI ordered bibimbap, which was very nice, served with three separate types of kimchi. One can mix the gochujang sauce as much as you'd like. We ordered multiple sushi dishes. All of them were exceptionally good. Their Udon is awesome probably better than the ramen. I'm still a bit conservative about the sashimi. Overall I am pretty satisfied.",

The food was fresh and flavorful. I really liked the vegetable tempura and was surprised that broccoli was included in addition to the typical onion, potato, and carrot. The veggies or at least the broccoli were so soft and I think they are perhaps precooked prior to frying. I recommend the tempura appetizer for people to share as there was enough to share with another person. The shrimp tempura roll was just as I expected. Nagomi is a new place that I will be adding to my list of places to pick up lunch while working in Ann Arbor. I want to try other dishes as there are a lot of yummy options. The restaurant has ample seating to accommodate multiple small groups and large groups.",
