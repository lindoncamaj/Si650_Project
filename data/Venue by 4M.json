Not the traditional sandwich I usually get.\nThe prices were a bit higher than I expected, however the service and atmosphere were exceptional.\nBeing an old A&P (and Kroger) I thought it would be an echo chamber. That was not the case. My wife and I were able to hold a conversation and still hear the music playing in the bar.\nI hope to utilize the podcasting facilities soon.\nOverall this is a nice place for an \"Upscale\" meal.",

The dipping sauce was dilly and delicious.\nThe queso fundido was thick and tasty. The chorizo topping tasted like chili. Super flavorful and enjoyable with fresh, thin, crispy & warm tortilla chips.\nI ordered the Caesar salad with salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The Caesar salad leaves were a bit watery and it came with anchovies on top, which added a bit of an added fishy flavor to the salad. I would’ve preferred less wetness and more dressing.\nOverall a wonderful meal with my family and we’ll definitely be back !",

                "description": "I came here with girlfriends and we all got plates to share on top of our meals. I will say, the hit was the Rosemary Table Bread! Omg was it delicious! I could have eaten the entire loaf myself! They got some other things they all raved about, but I wasn’t in the mood to try. I did get the Rotisserie Turkey Club with fries and it was very very good. The fries are thin cut like shoestring and had good flavor too. The meal didn’t take too long to come out and the atmosphere is very upscale and boutique-y. It is pretty open in there and the place is pretty big so at times it was loud, but the lighting was nice and the chef even came out and came by our table to chat with us. I would come back here for sure, especially with such an extensive menu.",

From the moment we walked in, Paisley provided exceptional service, making us feel welcomed and well-cared-for throughout our meal. Chef Thad truly showcases his talent with every dish, using top-notch ingredients that elevate the flavours to perfection. The drinks were superb, and the birria tacos were a standout—absolutely a must-try! We visited on a Saturday and were thoroughly impressed by both the quality of the food and the attentive service. This place is a gem, and I highly recommend it for a memorable dining experience. We will definitely be returning frequently!",

I like jazz, but this was a bit much for me.  We sat at the bar. My body wasn’t ready for that vibration. Not today. BUT….the eggs over gravy and ‘rolls’ (I’ve forgotten the formal name) was to Die For!  I will return for that breakfast!!!!! Some things were missing from the meal, but the bar tender told us this wasn’t her section and the follow-up tender fixed the charges and took off what we didn’t get. No biggie. We know this place well enough.",

Very unassuming from the outside… not sure we were in the right spot…. Maybe if it was better marked people would know it’s a restaurant….\n\nBig, open and inviting… live jazz, well lit.  Staff was friendly and food was delicious! Bloody Mary yummy! Not crowded which was nice… sometimes breakfast/brunch places are noisy and chaotic… this place is exactly what we were looking for.\n\nWe will be back!",
