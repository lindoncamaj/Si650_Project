The outdoor seating’s extra nice in the late summer/early fall when Main St closes off to traffic in the evening.\n\nOrdered the chicken sandwich and honestly enjoyed it. The steak frites are also just juicy and a good deal for the portion size and price. Also liked how straight to the point the menu here is. I’d come back for sure.",

I didn’t think that was possible and to have it be this good too… Wow.\nWent here for Mother’s Day and started with the shrimp and the sprouts. Shrimp were very good and crispy but the Brussels sprouts were heavenly. Super crispy with plenty of bacon. I had the fish tacos and the fish was super crunchy maybe just add a little more sauce.  I really enjoyed the corn tortillas they came in which were lightly fried to give them a little crispness.\n\nUPDATE:  Revisited in Mother’s Day 2024. Prices have gone up significantly.  The charcuterie board was great. The Lox appetizer was too heavy on the horseradish. The duck was overcooked and dry. Fish tacos were still good.",

The decor was pretty with colored lights for the holidays. I felt a little cramped in the booth but my husband, who’s taller, was fine. My Mediterranean Pasta was delicious, but unfortunately, most of the artichoke pieces were too tough or sharp. If it wasn’t for that, it would have been a favorite. I ordered it with shrimp, which were perfect. My husband liked his Michigan trout, mashed potatoes and salad. We shared a triple chocolate cheesecake that was worth every calorie. Yum. Their desserts are made there from scratch, I believe.",

                "description": "First time here.\n\nThe service was great and the place had a good vibe.\nI ordered Tune Poke Bowl. It was good but it was different than the ones I’ve had before. There’s usually a sweet taste in the ingredients of the bowl but this instead had pickled daikon radish which had a very strong taste and I couldn’t eat more than one piece. There was only one & a half slice of avocado in the bowl which usually is more than that.\n\nThe Brussels with bacon was really good but a bit oily, the coconut shrimp was very good.\n\nOverall it was a good experience and I would go back.",

                "description": "I thoroughly enjoyed this speakeasy atmosphere but modern-day décor. It’s dark, but warm but it is also very lively. This place is popular, many bodies fill up the place with a lovely and informative staff. I didn’t know what to get at first, but I had my server explain to me the options and which ones were popular among the crowd. I tried a few different things and everything that was handed to me was great in flavor. I think the portion size for what you are buying is very fair so don’t be afraid to try more, you won’t be saddened. The food menu does change so don’t be afraid to keep up, they even have specials on cocktails and even offer flights of bourbon and more. I felt very laid back here and left alone but very much helped by staff. I can see it as a good first date place where it’s energetic but also a place where you can get to know someone, be able to hear your party and enjoy every detail of the establishment. The only other detail I would keep in mind about this place is the parking, come early to arrive on time.",
