Manager said it happens all the time, didn\u2019t offer us a free treat or anything\u2026 the staff was really rude except for one girl who apologized. Just make sure you don\u2019t rely on the beeper and make sure you see your name on their board! Bc you\u2019ll get no sympathy from the manager. Idk if Donald was him or if that\u2019s just who the register was under when the girl took our order.",

When i got there they stated that they didnt have the bagels i requested. They were sold out. WTH why did you send me an email stating its ready. This is the 2nd time this happened. I spoke to a lady named Emily and i ask for the GM name so I can ask to speak to him she said she couldnt give me his name. If you want good customer services and get the food you ordered, please stay away from this place. Very disappointing with the structure of this business. I wish i can give this place a rating lower than 1.",

Had a simple order, pizza and soda for now...half tuna and soup to go for tomorrow.  Showed the flier, shown in the picture below, and was told I was set.\n\nGot to the back and everything was on a plater once finished and I stated that the sandwich and soup was to go, pizza was going to be ate at the location.  Young lady behind the counter found me annoying but slowly complied with my wished.  I then asked to make sure my school was credited the amount that me, and one of my students behind me, had spent for the fundraiser...I was quickly hit with that was only for orders.  I then showed the flier to the young lady and pointed out it said providing a copy in person was accepted...then was told the manager had to approve it.  The annoyed young lady then said to her coworker what a ****** I was...sorry for expecting things to be done right.  I stopped asking questions as I did not want to appear to be rude, remember I had students in the store.\n\nI went to the table to eat my now cold pizza and have my soda. I had to use napkins and a sanitizer to clean my table. After clearing my table and cleaning it again for the next person, I said goodbye to my students and headed home.\n\nOnce home I deconstructed my sandwich... pictured below.  There was more veggies on the sandwich than tuna.  I am also trying to figure out why it had a slice of bacon as well.\n\nStill not sure if the school will get any proceeds of mine or the students sales as that was never answered.  I work closely with the teacher who was having the fundraiser so I will be sharing this story with her as well.",
