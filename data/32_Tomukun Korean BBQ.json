I do appreciate how fresh and appetizing it looked though. The side dish appetizers sadly were tastier than the actual entree.\n\nThe service was also lacking. Our waiter was dry, seemed uninterested to serve us, and just didn’t seem like he wanted to be there.\n\nDespite everything I’ve heard about this place, I don’t think I’ll be returning.",

The mashed potatoes, served cold and containing bits of corn, cucumber, carrot, and pineapple, absolutely blew me away! As strange as it sounds, the flavor combination was spectacular- a must try! We enjoyed cooking our meats and vegetables at the table to our perfect degree of doneness. Delicious sides. Great service. If you are looking for unique, out of the ordinary tastes and a unique experience…you should definitely check this place out.",

We would have preferred to have more of the metal tongues so we can all try cooking the meat, and the waiter was barely there so we really didn't have a lot of opportunities to ask for stuff like salt, etc. Which I really wanted at one point. By the time he came around, we were already done.",

                "description": "I was quite disappointed with my recent lunch experience at Tomukun BBQ. Firstly, the service was clumsy and fell short of expectations when we were served with a dirty plate, which was off-putting. As for the food, it unfortunately didn't live up to the hype—lacking in flavor and quality. Additionally, despite the fact that there were only two of us dining during a less busy lunch hour, an 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill, which I found quite presumptuous and unwarranted for such a small party. This visit didn't measure up to the standards I hoped for.",
