                "description": "I was excited to try Anthony’s (Maple) and finally end my search for good pizza in the area.  Granted, only 1 sample size, but my 1 experience was poor.  Got a New York 16” with 2 (skimpy) toppings for $32 plus $2 in the jar.  The NY was not a NY.  It was a “thin crust” but that’s it.  Rather than the edges having a nice, chewy crust border…this pizza faded into a crunchy, cracker-like, ragged-edge, thinness.  It was overcooked and the edges were burnt.  Don’t know what the hype is about?  Maybe the Chicago, but not the NY.  I don’t mind spending on a quality product.  My NY was below average and way overpriced.  One and done.",

Location was tucked in a plaza and not easily seen from the road.\n\nOnce and a while treat due to the price ($30 for this small pizza)\n\nInterior, unwelcoming which included all but one staff member.

A medium All American deep dish pie can feed a family of 3 with left over slices for 2 the next day. That's $30 for dinner and a lunch snack the next day. If you go out to dinner, you could pay that if not more. The pizza is always delicious. I love the sauce!! They do curbside which is wonderful.",
