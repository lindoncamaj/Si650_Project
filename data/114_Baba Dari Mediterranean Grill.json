We split a small order of the grape leaves and a side of pita, and I got the chicken shawarma bowl with hummus and added feta, and Sarah got the build your own falafel salad bowl with hummus and garlic sauce. The grape leaves weren’t our favorite just because they were a bit on the slimey side, and that is not our preference, but the pita was soft and warm. The chicken shawarma bowl was great. The only thing I would change is to have more hummus, but this was an option to add more, so I will do that in the future. Overall, the food was great, and the meals were very filling. We would recommend this spot for a quick lunch or dinner.",

Small baba ganoush costs $4 and literally was just a sauce cup worth. Rice was $5 and wasn't impressive size wise and wasn't even garnished. The largest portion of food was the fattoush salad.\n\nI ordered my food over 2 hours early for pickup at 4:15, I had to wait 17 minutes for it to be ready with only two other customers eating in the store. I'm all for employees to be comfortable at work(they had earbuds in), but they were talking with family/off the clock employee behind the counter. Didn't apologize for my wait, and if I hadn't checked through my order then they would have let me walk out without two $6 drinks. They were pretty uninterested and distracted. Upgraded my drinks for free($1 value) but didn't apologize for forgetting them in the first place.\n\nThis place is best for takeout-lunch, look somewhere else if you want decent service, or fair food portions for money. Inside of the restaurant is pretty boring looking and undecorated, wouldn't suggest dining in.",
