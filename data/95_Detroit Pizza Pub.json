Our order included bruchetta, pistachio pesto pasta, veggie pizza, and garlic knots. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The in house made sangria is the best we have tasted anywhere. We were also given a private tour of the downstairs speak easy. The atmosphere is so hip and entertaining. A full cigar bar is also available. We learned that the site bakes all breads and doughs fresh, too. I highly recommend adding this to your must visit list.",

Maxx, the owner, and Carlos, the head chef, were incredibly accommodating and so helpful throughout the whole process, especially with figuring out how much food we‚Äôd need for a group that size. The food was absolutely incredible‚Äîeveryone we talked to raved about it! The pickle pizza, which we didn‚Äôt expect to be such a hit, ended up being a crowd favorite, and the calamari was just as popular.\n\nOur guests loved the wide selection of drinks and beers on draft, and the team was great about providing vegan options to meet our requests (amazing cauliflower wings!!). We also wanted to catch some college football during the event, and this place delivered! It had plenty of TVs, but without feeling like your typical sports bar, which was perfect for us.\n\nThe bartenders in our area were fast, super friendly, and so easy to work with.\n\nOverall, we couldn‚Äôt have been happier with how the day turned out.

                "description": "My original review was great for this place. But after many months of ordering, I am not pleased. Every single time we order from here, our pizza comes out different. This time, a tbsp of sauce was just plopped on top of the toppings on the end of each piece. The prices also differ for placing an online order vs. calling to place an order. Also, despite living a 4 minute walk/one block from the restaurant, our pizza always comes lukewarm, if not cold. Way too inconsistent and will not be coming back anymore",

                "description": "Came in on the later side to Ann Arbor and still on CA time with a kiddo. Staff was so awesome. Wish I caught his name (rude of me) but was really cool and showed us the Speakeasy as my husband and I wanted one of the beers they had on tap downstairs which was closed. Then made a Shirley Temple with my son (actually involved my son in making it).  Love having a kiddo but its rare to have the opportunity to go to someplace cool for adults and kids. And then to boot the pizza was excellent! Thanks for the cool experience and exceptional food. My husband comes to Ann Arbor for work several times so will definitely come back and recommend to  others.",
