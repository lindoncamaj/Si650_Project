BUT yesterday was the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced it. We walked in, and I immediately smelled a stench that smelled like something rotten. The waitress was not the usual lady we see, and she was not only slow, she was inattentive. We walked in to her eating and said we could sit down anywhere. The tables were all dirty. She brought me the water with lemon and the lemon seemed to be old and squishy. The food did not taste fresh like it always had, spicy hummus was hardly spicy, and my food did not taste the same (I always get the same thing). I\u2019m not sure if it was a different cook during that time or what, but overall I was disappointed. In the end, we were waiting on the server to ask us if we needed anything and to bring the check, we were obviously done eating. She was cleaning every last table and salt n pepper shaker in the entire place before my friend went up to ask for the things we needed. Highly disappointed in the service we received yesterday and incredibly grossed out over the smell of the building and the quality of freshness with our food. I won\u2019t be going back bcuz if it\u2019s like that ever again, I\u2019d be wasting my time and money..",

Another reviewer praised the crunchy bread wrap, but I found it cooked the lettuce and sandwich was rather dry and lacking flavor. Add some pickled turnip and some sauce! Where was the garlic? I guess the price was okay for this area. I'd still go back here to try other items based on other reviews, but have to travel to EL for a falafel sandwich.",
