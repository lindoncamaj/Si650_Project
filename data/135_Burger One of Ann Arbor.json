I always order chicken wings here and they are juicy and delicious. Chicken tenders are very juicy and well seasoned as well. I am sensitive to chicken smell and love this place\u2019s chickens.

We ordered Cajun fries for the table. I\u2019m not a fan of Cajun fries but everyone else enjoyed them. I was pressured into trying one. They were good. I just went with regular fries. Must of the group and the burger 1. It was topped with American Cheese, Mozzerella Sticks, Coleslaw, Turkey Bacon, Onion Rings, and Burger 1 Sauce. Holy moly! I had the Arbor burger. It was topped with Lettuce, Tomato, American, Swiss, Monterey Jack Cheese, Turkey Bacon, Fried Egg, Mayo, Ketchup, Pickles on A Brioche Bun. My wife had the ranch  wrap on a tomato basil wrap topped with Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Mayo, Turkey Bacon, Ranch, American Cheese. Excellent restaurant. Very enjoyable.",

                "description": "If you are looking for a great burger or patty melt look no further. I have been here twice now and both times the quality was consistently excellent.\n\nI've tried the Chapo burger and now the Patty Melt. I also got the East Coast fries this time. My girlfriend got the Patty Melt with American cheese and Burger 1 sauce.\n\nEasy easy easy recommendation for a burger. Worth the trip out to the area if you've got a craving.\n\nWe paid just under $30 for two patty melts, side of fries, side of east coast fries and one pop. It is slightly more than you might expect for that but the quality more than makes up for it.\n\nI'm posting this from my car just after leaving because it was so great. I will be back again soon!",
