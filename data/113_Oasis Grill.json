The falafels I ordered were served cold, which is not only unappetizing but also disappointing for a dish that is typically enjoyed warm and crispy.\n\nWhen I politely asked the staff if they could heat the falafels, I was met with an unexpected and unprofessional response. Instead of addressing my simple request, they chose to refund my order without any attempt to rectify the situation. While a refund might seem like a fair solution, it left me without a meal and feeling dismissed rather than valued as a customer.\n\nMoreover, the staff's behavior throughout the interaction was less than courteous. There was a clear lack of willingness to accommodate a basic request, and their abrupt handling of the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. A little effort to provide a better customer experience would have gone a long way.\n\nOverall, I was extremely disappointed with both the food and the service at [Restaurant Name]. I hope they take this feedback seriously and work on improving their customer service and food quality to ensure a better experience for future patrons.",

According to the menu on their website, this meal is supposed to include two grilled chicken kabobs, along with rice, pickles, homemade garlic sauce, and a side of hummus and pita, all for $11.50. However, when my order arrived, I only received one skewer.\n\nWhen I brought this issue to the attention of the staff, they were quite rude and dismissive, insisting that the lunch special is cheaper and therefore only includes one skewer. This is misleading and disappointing, as it contradicts the information provided on their website.\n\nI expect to receive what is advertised, and the unprofessional attitude of the staff only added to the negative experience.

Unfortunately the dressing was too much making the salad soggy and the chicken was either shawarma nor cooked the same day. It was dry and in very large chunks nor suitable for a salad. $17 salad (after tip and DoorDash fees) was disappointing",

Also they let me buy whole bags of pita bread which rocks because its way better than hrocery store pita. Seriously check this place out if u r in town! Dont skip it!\n\nI'm pretty picky when it comes to Mediterranean food because I grew up eating that type of food homemade so I'm always a little wary going into a new place but WOW 10/10 tastes just like my aunt made it. The bubba was nice and smokey and the wrap had a nice crunch and was well seasoned. Also a good deal amount of food for a reasonable price. If you dont go for the side then you can easily get out for under 10 dollars and still be full. As it is I now have leftovers (exciting!) I think this place just became my new comfort food place for whenever I'm missing the taste of home. Also, the gentleman at the register was very nice and the food came out very promptly! :)",
