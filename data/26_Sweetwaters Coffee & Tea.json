I could really taste the matcha (which was good quality) so I would definitely recommend. We also got the ice passion fruit tea that was great too. I would definitely recommend stopping in if you\u2019re in the area.",

                "description": "Was in Ann Arbor for vacation, and felt the need to start my day with a jolt of caffeine.  After a bit of looking around, I decided on Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea to kickstart my engine.  I ordered myself the Roasted Pistachio Latte, with almond milk to make it vegan.  The drink had a really nutty flavor, but softened just enough by the milk to be a lovely, warm sipper to wake up to.\n\nThe atmosphere inside felt just as warm and cozy as the drink in my hand, with local art along the walls and comfortable seats to cradle you close.  By the time I finished my drink and headed out the door I was more than ready for the day.",
