We ordered chicken fingers with fries, a BLT, a Reuben, and, of course, chili dogs. Every single bite was delicious. The chicken fingers were crispy, the BLT was perfectly balanced, and the Reuben had just the right amount of tang. And those chili dogs? Absolutely hit the spot. The food was amazing, and I canâ€™t wait to go back. Highly recommend this place if youâ€™re looking for some seriously good eats!",
