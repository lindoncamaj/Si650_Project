But this burger is really a treat. We also tried the coconut cream batidos, it was a fresh experience\n\nFor the non vegetarian options, \u2018the best snack ever\u2019 is a good option.\n\nThe only negative of this place was the long waiting queue for placing the order. Otherwise, 10/10 recommended.",

Combination of all different regions with a Cuban flair. food is outrageous! if in the ann arbor / Detroit area this is a must visit. Friendly helpful staff, order at counter, they bring it out to you. Very knowledgeable about menu items. parking close is street parking 430-530pm best time to find it. May have to go to parking garage. either way worth it.",
