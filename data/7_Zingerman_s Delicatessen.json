The Noels - Ryan, Alexa, Lillian, Izzy and their dog Zoey - love Ann Arbor, UofM, the Sleeping Bear\nSand Dunes in Glen Arbor ... and sandwiches! Admittedly, this sandwich creation leans more towards the parents\u2019 taste preferences\n(spicy!) than the kids, but given the family food motto of \"Don't Yuck My Yum\", the kids supported their parents' and the BarbeCuban\nbecame a reality! Hand-pulled spicy Cuban-style pork is topped with BBQ sauce, Vermont cheddar cheese, fire-roasted New Mexico\ngreen chiles and tangy cole slaw.

Your eyes are filled with the endless possibilities of which direction to go the moment you walk in the door. So much to take in - it made me smile from the get-go.   The sandwich was delicious - you do pay a little extra for the freshness - but it was well worth it. Quality all the way. I was a little confused about the ordering system, but someone was there to assist me. Once you've done it, the second time will be easy.  Would recommend stopping by if you are in the Ann Arbor area.",

I got the TNT Cowboy Reuben, which was top-notch. The bread was unique, and the meat was high quality. The flavor springs out at you. They make their own candy, shirts, meats, books (yes books), water bottles, chips, and anything you can think of in between. They also have a really nice outside seating area. The staff was nice and energetic. This is a really well-known spot around campus in A2! I heard a lot about Zingerman\u2019s on campus, then came here, and now understand what the hype is all about.",
