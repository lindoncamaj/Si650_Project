I had a beef enchilada and it basically had no flavor. However the side of refried beans were very good with a side if chips. The tamales were very tasty but I had a bite of a chicken taco and almost couldn't get it down. The chicken was super dry and chewy.  Someone at our table got the veggie Chimichanga and he gave up on it after 3 or 4 bites.\n\nWhen our family goes out for dinner it's considered a splurge and something special. Dropping over $100 for below average Mexican food as our food splurge was very disturbing.\n\nI think the issue is their menu is way to big.  7 full pages of options.  They need to scale it back and hone in on perfecting less offering IMOP.\n\n2 \u2b50 only for the service",
