The portion of the rice for nigiri shouldn't be large like theirs. Also, the rice was too sticky. It ruined the texture in my mouth. Then, I recognized the raw fish part wasn't really fresh. The worst part was their roll.. When I had the first bite, I immediately noticed that the fish in the roll was worse than those on the nigiri. I smelled something wasn't right, and I checked the texture and the color of the salmon, and it seemed fermented more than it was supposed to. Maybe they expected the spicy sauce might hide the bad salmon. But, as I am a sensitive person, I figured that I could never finish the plate and didn't even try to go further.\nThey might do better with their warm dishes. But, I don't think it's a place for sushi or roll.",

I would recommend getting one of the large dinner bento if your really hungry or else just go for one of the simple rolls, as the quantities here are massive.\n\nThe customer service was exceptional as the staff were helpful in getting me to decide what exactly to get. The inside decor is simple and traditional and the sushi chefs at the back really look like they are pro at what they do.\n\nI do recommend coming here in the near future and do look forward to coming here!",

I called to ask to get a salmon roll instead and the manager I spoke with was very rude. She said I just looked at the tuna and it’s perfectly fine, why are you saying that, and also insisted they had put spicy mayo inside it. I literally unrolled and dissected one of the pieces to make sure it wasn’t there and it definitely wasn’t. I ate two pieces and was worried the tuna would make me sick so I threw out the rest, but unfortunately she refused to give me a different roll so I went hungry for lunch.\n\nHer attitude was genuinely shocking, a salmon roll costs like $8 so it’s not like i was asking for something crazy.
