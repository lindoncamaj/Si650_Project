                "description": "This place is amazing \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf2!! It's really small so there's not much seating, but the food is spectacular!! The spice \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f is on point, the seasoning is brilliant, and the flavors are absolutely beautiful. The portions are ginormous too. Just note that the wait time is always super long, so make sure to order well in advance.",

                "description": "Great food, filled with spice and seasonings. One of the most authentic Jamaican restaurants in AA and the Metro Detroit area. However for the price customers should receive more meat when ordering dinners. Tons of rice and veggies but don't skimp on the meat! Also $5 for a beverage is highway robbery. Service is friendly and the food is always fresh.",

As usual the food was fantastic and the waitress was also great. Chicken was so tender with the perfect amount of spice. Rice & peas (beans), sauteed vegetables, and plantains were also great. One of my favorite places to eat in A2.",
