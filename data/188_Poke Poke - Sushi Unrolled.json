Francis (hiring area manager) is sketchy and makes false promises when you’re hired (ie: you’ll be training as a manager and get stuck as a dishwasher/ line helper), Laurence (area training manager) is the only decent person there but he’s barely there, And the shift lead sahad, she’s just unpleasant and will regularly bump into you without saying excuse me. Honestly one of the worst group of people and working experiences I’ve come across.",

I got the Tuna lover bowl and it was just awesome. Loved the spicy tuna and spicy mayo on top. And the worker who served me was super helpful after I told her it was my first time. Definitely going back to try more things and maybe I'll get adventurous and try to create my own.\n\nThe only bad thing I could say is that this large bowl was $15. Pricy, but expected given it's sushi grade tuna.",
