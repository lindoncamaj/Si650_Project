He stated that someone would be around to get us whatever we needed, being that we just received our dinner when we were asked to be cashed out.  No one checked on us. So, unfortunately, we had to get our own boxes. Other than that, everything was amazing. Where I work, we don't allow the servers to cash out guests until they are done eating even if it's shift change or not. They keep the table until the end of their dining experience.",

However, the staff WAS so kind. They closed at 9 but still served us. Lyndsey, our server, was quick, and helpful! She then told us the manager told us to pick out two free desserts and have a sparkle! They congratulated us and went ABOVE and BEYOND. We didn‚Äôt call ahead and didn‚Äôt ask for any favors. They really put the customer first and they sealed our night on the best note possible. THANK YOU UNION REC!!!",

We also tried their bandeja bowl with BBQ cauliflowers. We couldn't decide which one we liked more. The ambience is nice and service was good as well.",

                "description": "A great restaurant with a great vibe. It is definitely tucked away, looking like a warehouse bucked behind an auto repair shop, but once you find it you‚Äôll be glad you did. Union Rec has a creative drink menu with food offerings that go beyond la comida Tez M√©x. Joe, my bartender and the rest of the staff are fun, attentive and engaging. I devoured a set of tacos; the Chicken  Tinga, Korean Pulled Pork, and the Brazilian Brisket with a margarita to was it all down. Very yum.  They also have a private event room and coffee shop that opens at 7:00 am. If you haven‚Äôt, you need to check the place out. You can also enjoy free WiFi with electric outlets and hooks for your belongings at the bar. Always busiest on game day.",

I have to say that it actually wasn't bad. The food was good, the service was amazing, and the atmosphere was pretty cool! When we walked in, the person that seated us was very friendly and kind. Our waitress was very attentive and was ready to answer any questions we might have had. I'm pretty sure we will be eating here again in the next 2 years, considering that's how much longer our daughter will be a student at u of m. Give this place a try. You will not regret it!",
