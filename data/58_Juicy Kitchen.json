From the food to the service and hospitality, everything is exceptional.\nThe owner, who greeted us warmly, is incredibly welcoming and communicative. The staff members are friendly, warm, and extremely helpful. Words can't quite capture how wonderful this place is. Don't be surprised by its small size and tucked-away location in a plaza, it's truly a hidden gem in Ann Arbor!",

We tried a few dishes, including the vegan burrito, hot mess, southwestern hash, and slider (vegan). For the vegan versions, they replace egg with tempeh and the cheese with spicy mayo. Overall, the vegan options were okay, but did not seem their specialty. Also al of the dishes had a spicy sauce I wasn’t a fan of. The vegan baked goods were good though and highly recommend the coffee over the chai.",

                "description": "I’ve been meaning to try this place for a while, and I finally found a good time to grab some breakfast. The people working there are so warm. They have so many delicious and healthy options. You feel like you’re paying for quality food. I especially loved their breakfast burritos, and their overnight oats were a hefty portion loaded with tons of good stuff. Flavorful and made with care. Far better breakfast fare than I can usually find on a busy morning. I think I’ll become a regular!",

I hadn’t eaten lunch yet so I decided to find something close to my route and juicy kitchen is what I found.  When I walked in I was instantly greeted by one of the employees. he did an amazing job helping me choose something since this was my first time in the restaurant. Any questions I had were not only answered by him but also by the extremely friendly staff in the back area. While I was ordering I noticed that someone was cleaning and organizing at all times. As a business owner myself to see employees that actually cared about their workplace made me smile. I ordered the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage and a strawberry orange mango smoothie. I’ll start with the smoothie. I’ve had a lot of smoothies in my life but this was definitely one of the best. You could taste the real fruit not like other places that use concentrates. It was very creamy cold and refreshing. I could’ve told you about the food in the beginning but what would a story be without a little suspense. Usually when you go into a smaller restaurant everyone has their spin on a breakfast burrito and nine times out of 10 they always put way too many ingredients. but not the juicy kitchen. It was the perfect sized burrito. not too big to where every bite everything falls apart and not too small that it didn’t fill me up. All the ingredients inside the burrito perfectly accented all the other ingredients and it was the perfect portion of each ingredient that you’re able to taste all the flavors and enjoy it. Nothing overpowered anything else. Overall for my experience I would give this place a 10 out of 10 very happy and pleased with the service greatly enjoyed the food and the staff and I will definitely be back the next time I am in the area.",
