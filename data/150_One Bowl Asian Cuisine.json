                "description": "It's very easy to tell if the ramen they serve you will or will not taste good by how it looks when they present it to you, and by taking a sip of the broth. Unfortunately, the chicken katsu ramen did not pass either of the two criteria. Despite this, though, it's still edible and I wanted to just leave this review with a 3 star rating. However, when they gave me the bill, they told me the ramen is 14.85, not 13.25 on their old menu from 6 years ago. Maybe they should have told me that before? To make matters worse, they then slap you a mandatory 18% \"gratuity fee\" without offering much of a service apart from serving you one cup of water. I think they confused \"basic restaurant hospitality\" with \"entitled tips\".\n\nWow.\n\nIt felt like they served you the bare minimum and then slap you across the face for it. I'm sorry, but that ramen and your \"service\" is definitely not worth $18.59.\n\nI will definitely not be coming back.",
