I haven\u2019t found something I don\u2019t like at Happy Wok! I love going here, it\u2019s our favorite takeout place. We always get the General Tso Chicken, the sweet and sour chicken, and the crab rangoons. I highly recommend!",

I\u2019ve tried the sweet and sour chicken, almond chicken, and shrimp lo mein and it was all really good. The prices are very reasonable and you get plenty of food to fill up for lunch. I\u2019m going to keep trying more stuff on the menu but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be just as good. I highly recommend this place if you want a very good and quick take out meal of Chinese food. This is one of the better places in the Ann Arbor area.",

I stay in Ann Arbor while in Michigan. First time Happy Wok customer from Maine living in Ann Arbor for business for a few months and I absolutely love Chinese food, chinese people, their culture and their amazing food and cooking skills. I ordered Chicken Egg Roll = B, Fried Pork Pot Stickers = C, General Tso Chicken Wings = A++ but the $17.95 Seafood Fries Rice = F. Worst Fried rice I\u2019ve ever had. The base fried rice itself was poor and had no taste then they throw in very smelly tiny scallops, the worst smelling half lobster tail ever like smelly seafood, about (6) 26-30 ct shrimp and then a ton of Surimi aka fake or imitation crab meat and the quality was disgusting like soft tissue and smelled and tasted like nothing. My picture shows about a pound of surimi, imitation crab meat but the overall quality was gross and smelled terrible. We literally gagged when we tried eating the seafood fried rice and I had to take out all of the surimi imitation crab because it was making me so sick. So disappointed as I love seafood but this rice was disgusting. I feel terrible even saying it because I don\u2019t want the restaurant seems legit and the man at front counter is super nice and probably family of owners or is the owner but they show the seafood fried rice and seafood lo mein in the Google gallery but believe me it smells and tastes terrible. Just my opinion but I\u2019ve eaten Chinese food all over the country and this dish just doesn\u2019t cut it. Sorry Happy Wok but the Seafood Fried Rice just doesn\u2019t cut it.",
