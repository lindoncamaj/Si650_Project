I’ve tried the sweet and sour chicken, almond chicken, and shrimp lo mein and it was all really good. The prices are very reasonable and you get plenty of food to fill up for lunch. I’m going to keep trying more stuff on the menu but I’m sure it’ll be just as good. I highly recommend this place if you want a very good and quick take out meal of Chinese food. This is one of the better places in the Ann Arbor area.",

I stay in Ann Arbor while in Michigan. First time Happy Wok customer from Maine living in Ann Arbor for business for a few months and I absolutely love Chinese food, chinese people, their culture and their amazing food and cooking skills. I ordered Chicken Egg Roll = B, Fried Pork Pot Stickers = C, General Tso Chicken Wings = A++ but the $17.95 Seafood Fries Rice = F. Worst Fried rice I’ve ever had. The base fried rice itself was poor and had no taste then they throw in very smelly tiny scallops, the worst smelling half lobster tail ever like smelly seafood, about (6) 26-30 ct shrimp and then a ton of Surimi aka fake or imitation crab meat and the quality was disgusting like soft tissue and smelled and tasted like nothing. My picture shows about a pound of surimi, imitation crab meat but the overall quality was gross and smelled terrible. We literally gagged when we tried eating the seafood fried rice and I had to take out all of the surimi imitation crab because it was making me so sick. So disappointed as I love seafood but this rice was disgusting. I feel terrible even saying it because I don’t want the restaurant seems legit and the man at front counter is super nice and probably family of owners or is the owner but they show the seafood fried rice and seafood lo mein in the Google gallery but believe me it smells and tastes terrible. Just my opinion but I’ve eaten Chinese food all over the country and this dish just doesn’t cut it. Sorry Happy Wok but the Seafood Fried Rice just doesn’t cut it.",
