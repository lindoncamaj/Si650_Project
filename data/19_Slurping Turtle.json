                "description": "This was my second time at Slurping Turtle, and the frist time since Covid. II was not let down, I got the California poke bowl and one of the seasonal beverages. It was quite loud in there and it was very busy. We did wait about 30 minutes for a table, but they had a callback (or textback) service, so we were able to walk around a bit while we waited and the host was very friendly.\nMy food was fresh and tasted good, the drink was also good. The only downside I think I can list were the prices, I know it's downtown Ann Arbor, but I thought my entree was a dollar or two overpriced.\nI would definitely eat here again, the duck fat fried chicken ramen looked tempting and I did think the ramen prices were a little more fair. I think I would probably have an even more enjoyable experience during non-peak times.",

We had 8 (was going to be 12) people with us and they seated us in this cool community table style spot on the lower floor. We worked with Melissa to plan and pre-selected our menu and it was very easy. They even printed a custom menu for our dinner!\n\nThe Bao was absolutely amazing. The Gyoza were amazing too. The heart of romaine salad was really unique and tasty. As a main we had two types of ramen, the classic pork belly was so good! We also had a vegetarian fried rice that was delicious. The assorted puff pasteries for dessert were wonderful and the overall atmosphere was great. We also really enjoyed that it wasnt too loud and we could all talk and hear each other.",
