What was even worse, was the excuse management attempted to give for their below lack luster type service. As pictured, establishment was barely 1/2 full but that was \u201cbusy\u201d. 30mins to order food, 30mins to get us our bills as we watched management give his own family at a table 5 star service while our server elected to randomly clean tables as if we didn\u2019t exist. The lack of prioritization was astonishing. After finally getting our food, orders were incorrect and food was lack luster. After seeing the behavior of management, I\u2019m not even surprised at the servers inabilities. We remained kind and refrained from making a scene which would have been fully justified.

                "description": "Solid food and read fast! We ordered around 4pm and it was ready in under 15 minutes! Their wings are reliably and you know what you are getting. Best wings in the world? No. But solid if you like the flavorings offered. To be honest the reason that brought us back for a second time so soon is the fries! The are a really delicious shoestring with just the right about of crunch.",

After waiting for 25 minutes and after three failed attempts to someone to take my order I decided to leave. A Waiter never came to my table and I don't want to be told they were short staffed because there were plenty of people walking around not working. I walked out and probably will never go back to this one.",

Several wings came with no sauce and another came with the sauce on the side, but I ordered sauces for all of them and none were supposed to be on the side.
