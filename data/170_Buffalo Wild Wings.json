What was even worse, was the excuse management attempted to give for their below lack luster type service. As pictured, establishment was barely 1/2 full but that was “busy”. 30mins to order food, 30mins to get us our bills as we watched management give his own family at a table 5 star service while our server elected to randomly clean tables as if we didn’t exist. The lack of prioritization was astonishing. After finally getting our food, orders were incorrect and food was lack luster. After seeing the behavior of management, I’m not even surprised at the servers inabilities. We remained kind and refrained from making a scene which would have been fully justified. Y’all looked like clowns!",

Best wings in the world? No. But solid if you like the flavorings offered. To be honest the reason that brought us back for a second time so soon is the fries!

A Waiter never came to my table and I don't want to be told they were short staffed because there were plenty of people walking around not working.
