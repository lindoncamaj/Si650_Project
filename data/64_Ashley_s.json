                "description": "We went on a game day. It was very busy and  our server was new. Our food came out quickly but getting a beer took forever. We ordered waffle fries with bacon and ranch. We also got the poutine. Both were great but the poutine came in a little bowl. I thought it would have been larger, but it was still very tasty. The bathrooms are downstairs. They have outdoor seating. Their draft beer selection is large. I had a Carmel apple cider. It was delicious! The atmosphere is fun and easy going. It's definitely a fun place to go after a Michigan game. The manager was very nice to us and the staff was also friendly. They also have TV's everywhere.",

Baked in a cute individual pan this mac and cheese was the right amount of filling. You can tell it was made for you. I loved the burger as well! It's exactly what you expect from a classic pub burger and more! And did I mention waffle fries are the norm here? They were so good! Thank you!",
