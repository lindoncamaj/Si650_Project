It’s hard not to appreciate good design, and this restaurant is just nicely laid out and designed. The food here was pretty good. Went for the Zhoug Knight and just devoured the whole thing. Portion sizes are generous and the speed of service was just impressive. We got our rolls out within just 10 minutes of ordering.

Don was extremely helpful and patient in reviewing the menu options and his recommendations. The place is small, cozy, well lit, and had plenty of parking options.

I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual dinner (or a great lunch). I cannot express enough how thoughtful their food is.\n\nSpiedo does rotating menus of wraps, rice bowls, and sides. The wraps and rice bowls are amazing (the spicy pork, walleye, chicken, kielbasa, and spicy tofu are all really, really great. The falafel’s the only one I’d forgo for the others).\n\nAs good as the main dishes are, the sides are even better. The farmer’s cheese is amazing. They had a lemon chicken rice soup for a while that was one of the best soups I’ve ever had. Other ones I’ve loved from past and current menu rotations are the roasted cabbage, griddled potatoes, eggplant, phkali (carrot puree) dip, smashed cucumber, and heirloom tomato. It’s hard to go wrong with the sides - I suggest you prioritize them when deciding what to order. The creativity is just phenomenal - dishes are packed with fresh herbs, lots of texture, and flavor combinations that work very well.\n\nThe chocolate tahini milkshake is amazing as well.",

It’s pricey man like I feel like for the price of the wrap it should at least come with fries or chips or something. Outdoor seating is pretty nice vibs",

They’ve got a super convenient barcode system for ordering, which made grabbing a table and diving into the menu a snap.\n\nWe tried a range of vegan dishes, each with its own unique twist.\n\nThe Charred Cabbage was a standout, topped with a tangy tahini ranch and sweet pomegranate molasses.\n\nThe Cauliflower dish was fresh and zesty, and those Griddle Potatoes? Cheesy, herby, and just plain delicious.\n\nDon’t even get me started on the Tofu Mafia Rice Bowl – it was a flavor-packed punch with a kick from the chili crisp.\n\nEven snagged a bite of the Zhoug Knight chicken – tender and perfectly spiced.\n\nService was friendly and fast. For anyone looking for great vegan food (and a bit more), Spiedo’s a winner. Would totally recommend!\n🤤",
