                "description": "Awful Food! Pre ious order was great . Tonight 9/23.2024 Terrible! We ordered 3 bowls the Salmon was the size of a sardine and almost 20.00, the blackened chicken no sauce , the sweet potatoes were dry and wrinkled, the rice was like glue, the veg slaw had about 4 carrots and the brussel sprouts looked like maybe kale greens and burnt. The steak bowl the meat was gray. We took them back for a remake and asked for the manager, and He refused to come from the back and address our concerns. They remade them and told us  that the all the brussel sprouts looked like that tonight. The second remake was just as bad as the first. The taste was of charred burnt food. This is way too expensive to put out poor quality food like this. Save Your money this is awful",

That being said this location is awesome when you go inside and order at the counter, but if you order pickup ahead of time in the app, or order delivery, 10/10 times your bowl will be disappointing with multiple missing ingredients and very small portions compared to when you order in shop. It\u2019s a big bummer because the convenience of ordering ahead in the app and picking up on your way home is such a plus.\n\nEdited to add that they started adding an automatic tip to your purchase in-store. I am happy to tip for table service. Being tricked into tipping for counter service and disposable dishes feels wrong. Just pay your staff.",
