                "description": "I wanted to try this place out so I gave it a shot. When I walked in there was a menu on a chalkboard wall. I walked up to the counter to order and two gals were discussing a problem at the register. The one said she was going to take my order and they could finish the conversation when she was done, but the other one wasn’t listening and just kept talking. She had to cut her off and say she was going to take my order, which I’m glad for because I really didn’t want to keep waiting while they hashed that out.\nI ordered a Northside BLT with homemade chips, pickle and an m&m cookie. It cost close to $18.00, which I feel is pretty high for a sandwich/chips/cookie. I did enjoy the sandwich, having avocado on it. The chips were quite good as well. I would come back here and meet a friend for lunch. There’s a pretty large dining area for sitting too.",

Ordered the lemon pesto chicken salad on a brioche bun today and this was DELICIOUS! 😋 also, tried the dirty taro latte... it was good but did not taste sweet like the taro bubble tea you'll find. The bacon BLT sandwich plus their homemade chips hit the spot too!\n\nSept 2022\nUpdate - Iced ginger tea was excellent and a cup of hot tumeric ginger tea was enjoyed by my friend. Good for the immune system too!\n\nGreat food, lattes, and atmosphere for meeting up with friends, colleagues and clients. Plenty of space to work too.\n\nHad the pistachio turkey sandwich today, which was good, but the bacon pesto grilled cheese was divine! All the flavors blended well together. Don't forget to order a side of their homemade chips.\n\nCheck out their omelettes too!\n\nMy friend always gets the lavender latte, and I had the rosemary salted caramel latte today.

It seems that business entrepreneurs favor this for meetings and laptop work.\n\nThere's not much on the lunch menu without mayo, but the caprese sandwich was pretty good. Although, the mozzarella was cold and the bread was hot, which was a bit odd.\n\nService was super friendly! But I'm not a fan of how they assign you a table, but do not walk you to the table. Somebody's bags were being stored at our assigned table and it just made for an awkward situation. I think it's better to give the customers their number and let them choose where to sit, to be honest. Especially if there are no waitress services.\n\nThere's plenty of parking and it's definitely kid friendly. Changing tables are in the bathrooms and they have a few high chairs.",

                "description": "I recently visited Songbird near UMICH North Campus and was impressed by the cafe’s fantastic interior and vibe. The ambiance is truly delightful! However, my experience with the hot cocoa left me somewhat disappointed. It tasted more like water than chocolate, and the mild flavor was not to my liking. Despite this, I’m still eager to explore their dishes on my next visit. The overall atmosphere makes it a place worth returning to.",
