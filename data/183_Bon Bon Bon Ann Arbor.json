Each chocolate rectangular bowl is filled with a thoughtful combination of fillings and textural components highlighting a complementary flavor pairing. Staff are friendly and patient.

Plenty of parking, although you must pay up to the designated times unless you know someone I don\u2019t. Located in Nickels Arcade, there is a small shop called Bon Bon Bon and they have a wonderful selection of small chocolates amongst different flavors and aesthetics. They arrange them visibly so you can see each individual chocolate with their name and with a description containing its contents. They have their usual popular flavors and they do switch out and or add more options every so often and holidays to switch up the taste. The workers here are kind and can assist with any questions about the store. After choosing your chocolates they are all grouped and personally packaged, cutesy packaging I might add. After deciding which chocolates you\u2019d like to devour, they do have merchandise they sell as well that range from hats, sweatshirts, accessories and more. I saw this shop randomly on my lunch break and I am glad that I did because after carefully choosing which 6 chocolates I wanted I came back a day or two later to buy more and to get extras to take home. Mind you, I live in a different state so I was a bit worried, but they traveled really well with me. If you like chocolate, do it. Do it.",
