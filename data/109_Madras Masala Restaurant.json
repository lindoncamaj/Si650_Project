                "description": "They have diverse menu in veg and non-veh, but we went for vegetarian and had ordered onion rava masala dosa, Mysore masala dosa, cut mirchi, garlic cheese masala dosa, rice and dal, wada, idli, and tea. The dosas were tasty, though it would have been perfect if the masala was inside the dosa rather than served on the side. The idli was good, while the wada was just okay. The cut mirchi was huge but didn't quite match the taste of those we savor in Telangana or Andhra restaurants.\n\nUnfortunately, the tea was disappointing, but the staff graciously removed it from the bill.\n\nAdditionally, it would be better if the chutneys were freshly made and served on the same day. They were cold, likely because they had been prepared the night before and stored in the refrigerator.\n\nService was commendable, with the owners themselves managing and providing warm hospitality. Overall, a good spot with room for slight improvements in certain dishes.",

We also ordered chicken biryani which was good in taste but the rice was sticky which gave a feeling of pulav instead of biryani.

Priscilla was a joy to work with - she made great suggestions for the menu, answered all my questions, kept in contact throughout the planning, and accommodated a last minute food allergy. We brought in our own table settings  and balloons…our guests had a wonderful time and absolutely LOVED the food. I can’t wait to have another party here! 10/10 - highly recommend!!",

Seems like they are reusing the same frying oil for everything :(. But other than that, THE OTHER FOOD IS AMAZE. Imo, one of the best Indian places in Ann Arbor. Is it THE best? I’m conflicted now.
