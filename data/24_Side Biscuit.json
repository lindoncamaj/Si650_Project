They were playing Norwegian folk rock and the general ambiance of all the staff was upbeat and cheerful.\n\nThe wings were DELICIOUS. My partner had the gochuchang and I had the panang. I almost fell out of my seat when they brought our biscuits - aged smoked cheddar, corn, jalape\u00f1os, and tajin compound butter. I'm pregnant and have been wild about tajin lately.\n\nUpon hearing this the owner ran in to get me a tajin lime wing they were testing out. It was amazing! He also double checked that I was okay with some of the ingredients in the parang, which was very thoughtful.\n\nI am very inspired by the owners story, and how his business really grew out of this grassroots, community love of food and sharing experiences. We will TOTALLY be back next time we are in town.\n\n10/10 worth every penny!!!",

All of the other wings were excellent, but it was a toss up on what the second favorite was. I'm normally not a fan of dry rub, but the brogarashi was excellent and I loved the spice & flavor on the Gucci gang. I thought the Penang was on the weaker side but still worth trying. I still need to try the biscuits but the wings were ready very quickly and I'm looking forward to trying out more wings in the future.",

No other wings even come Close to this place in my opinion. The loaded fries are awesome too. The prices haven\u2019t changed in years. Highly, highly, highly recommend.",

I got the buffalo wings, the sauce was spicy and vinegary, the chicken was juicy, and the whole thing lasted only five minutes before I cashed it. The miso biscuit was excellent too, it was flaky and salty, perfect with the spicy wings. Can't wait for them to fully open, I already want more right now.",
