Metzger Paining is my go-to painting contractor from now on. Fantastic quality they make sure they do it right the first time and are always willing to fix anything. Chuck, one of the Superintendent's on some of the projects is always dependable and a great communicator. Carlos worked on some of my projects, and he is a master painter, fantastic quality. Chris is also great to work with and the team in the office are a pleasure and very responsive. Super experience with this company! And LOCAL!",

In a day where it is difficult to get quality products and service Metzgers  far exceeds both. We were so pleased with the outcome and although our home in Westbrook is over 30+ years old, it feels fresh and new. Best investment ever to use Metzgers!",

There are large areas of our house such as the front entry, garage doors and the back of the house that are left unfinished after four months.  Other areas were poorly painted initially with sawdust and debris in the paint, over spray, severe tape damage and lousy coverage in general.\nAfter inspecting the work with his foreman Jeremiah assured us the work was substandard and all the repairs would be addressed. The following day Jeremiah insisted on another $16,000+ to finish the job.\nWe vehemently disagreed with paying additional money when he had not completed the original contract.\nHe has many excuses as to why he is not responsible.  This was a large remodel and we have not had this type of difficulty with any other sub on this job.\nWe are significantly disappointed and offered him every attempt to behave professionally and complete his contract.\nFor the first time ever, we have filed an official complaint with the register of contractors.",
