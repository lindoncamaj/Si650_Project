                "description": "I had the rigatoni bolognese It was good but not fantastic. Could have been a little hotter but it was tasty. I would eat there again. Atmosphere is great. Great place for a date or a family reunion. Not particularly a good place for a solo diner, but that's not a slam against the restaurant. I recommend it and would eat there again without any problem.",

A bit pricey but worth every penny.\n\nWe had wine flights which allows you to try multiple different wines and it is comes on a placemats that tells you what wine it is. Pretty cool",
