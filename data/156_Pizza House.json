It has a great atmosphere and it wasn't too busy on a Sunday at lunchtime. There were great beer options as well. It's also very close to the University of Michigan campus so we walked over there after we ate. Highly recommend!",

I heard great things about the feta bread, so I had to try it, and it exceeded my expectations. I may just come back here for it again. The pizza and wings I had were fine but not particularly memorable, but the feta bread was outstanding. I am definitely coming back to this place for a game day or just to enjoy the feta bread.

                "description": "Pizza House in Ann Arbor offers tasty food and decent service, but be prepared for a serious sticker shock. I recently dined there and was frankly floored by the final bill. We ordered two small vegetarian pizzas, a salad, and a kids' meal, which came to a staggering $123 after a 5% service charge was added. When we questioned our waitress about the price, she confirmed that a small vegetarian pizza was indeed $28. While the pizzas were good, they certainly weren't that good.\n\nIt's possible there was a mistake in the order entry. Perhaps we were charged for large pizzas instead of small or maybe a deep dish, or maybe there were some extra toppings added inadvertently. $28 for a small vegetarian pizza, even in a popular college town, seems incredibly high. I've dined at many pizzerias, and this price point is significantly higher than average for a basic vegetarian pizza, regardless of size.\n\nThe 5% service charge added to the bill also felt a bit unusual. While I appreciate restaurants ensuring their staff is compensated, adding a mandatory service charge feels a little sneaky. It certainly added to the overall feeling of being overcharged.\n\nSetting aside the price, the food itself was enjoyable. The pizzas were well-made with fresh ingredients and a nicely cooked crust. The salad was fresh and crisp. Our waitress, despite the pricing confusion, was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. Unfortunately, we will probably never be back.",

Toilet downstairs overflowing. Reported to staff they simply directed me to the upstairs restroom. Remained that way for two hours. Server disappeared at times for 15 minutes or more. Food came out of kitchen staggered by more than 20 minutes. Order accuracy was pathetic. I contacted store through website and received zero feedback.",

Especially enjoyed the Southern BBQ option and the House Special as always.\nReally wanted to shout-out to their amazing lasagne which surprised our group! Such a rich and savory treat with great choice of cheese too! Loved every last bit of it.",
