Great beer selection, friendly staff, wonderful atmosphere, and  the perfect spot for a hot day.\n\nWalking through a cool mist with beers in hand, right before you find a place to sit, was welcomed on a 90+ degree day.(I went on Amazon and bought this amazing misting hose attachment while we sat and drank our beers. Message me if you want the product details)\n\nYou can rent games such as chess, checkers, Jenga, etc. And set up shop at a picnic table with friends.\n\nHighly recommend!",

Also, bc it\u2019s outdoors it is animal friendly. There would be 5 stars if this place had an indoor area so it could be open all year.",

I had a lot of fun here - it's the perfect place for a nice summer evening. Pro tip: bring some cards / games to play; it'll greatly enhance your experience!! My only wish is that they had food options, maybe some light appetizers??",
