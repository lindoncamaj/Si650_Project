                "description": "After a vigorous morning workout, my friend and I were ravenous and in search of a hearty meal. Blue Tractor BBQ & Brewery seemed like the perfect pit stop. Tucked in the heart of town, this spot not only promises a commitment to local produce and finely crafted beers but also a tempting BBQ menu that we couldn’t wait to dive into.\n\nFood Ordered:\nWe opted for the BBQ Platters, which were a delight to our taste buds but left us wanting a bit more in terms of portion size — perhaps not quite enough to fully satisfy two exercised appetites.\n-The Sliced Beef Brisket was a standout, expertly smoked for 18 hours with a simple salt and pepper rub; it was as tender as it was flavorful.\n-The Smoked Chicken thighs, brined and smoked to perfection, hit that smoky sweet spot beautifully.\n-The Sausage Link, less salty than typical sausages and featuring a special sauce or marinade, was a pleasant surprise in both taste and texture.\n\nFor sides, the Sweet Potato Fries were a delicious pick, and the Braised Greens added a nice balance to the meat-heavy platter.\n\nAlthough we initially craved a Salmon Sandwich, it was no longer available. The staff recommended another fish filet sandwich (the name escapes me), which turned out to be delicious and perfectly seasoned — a serendipitous substitute that did not disappoint.\n\nBrews and More:\nDon't miss the happy hour from 3-6 pm daily, where you can enjoy half-price sides and brews. It's a fantastic deal, especially for tasting their award-winning craft beer.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nBlue Tractor BBQ & Brewery impresses with its commitment to local sourcing and high-quality ingredients. The atmosphere is ideal for relaxing post-workout, and while the portions could be larger, the delicious flavors and excellent service make it well worth a visit. Highly recommended for a genuine A^2 dining experience.",

The BBQ chips were good and better then the fries.  The waffle fries were above average but mashed potatoes we below average.   The normal BBQ sauce was good but the vinegar based was very thin.   I would try again and would like to try the ribs.",

In just a few minutes we were enjoying one of the best burgers and fries (sweet potatoes) I’ve had in my life!!. The beer was really good as well. It’s not cheap but I gladly paid the bill for an excellent service and even better food! Don’t know how the service is when it’s full, but I’m definitely coming back to this place when I return to Ann Arbor.",
