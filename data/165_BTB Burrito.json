Current stars reflect this stated policy along with the delicious food.\n\nI will amend this review accordingly if the policy changes. I've been a fan and advocate for the shredded chicken deluxe burrito since the Big Ten days. How disappointing to find that BTB won't provide tap water to paying customers (should be free to anyone that asks). The State/Packard location always had cups available. The cashier at Cantina was great, no fault to them, but the policy is inexcusable.",
