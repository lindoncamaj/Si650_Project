I got the lentil soup, lamb meatloaf in a spicy tomato sauce, and finished the meal with a Turkish coffee and chocolate cake. Everything was absolutely incredible. You can tell the care that goes into every dish. I will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu.",

We will definitely go back soon!\n\nUpdate: We came back two weeks later and the food was once again truly delicious. The staff were also very friendly, and the environment was clean and cozy. Please be aware that the menu changed from last time, so I believe the specials are updated regularly.\n\nUpdate 03/03/2022: We came with a friend today for dessert. Even though we arrived half an hour before closing, they very kindly let us in and the food was delicious! I particularly liked the Noah's Pudding, made with tasty rose water syrup. The restaurant was immaculately clean and very welcoming.\n\nUpdate 03/19/2022: We experienced the special meze event with a dear friend of ours. The food was excellent and had clearly taken great effort to prepare. I particularly liked the stuffed cabbage and spicy atom. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, and the owner was incredibly flexible to accommodate our needs.",

I liked the Allspice Chicken I ordered today. It’s served with rice with vermicelli, and I added the red lentil soup. The Ground Lamb with Eggplant entree looked pretty solid as well. They have a variety of cold desserts, some actually quite healthy. I can’t say enough about how delicious and healthy everything is here... and so different from the usual dining spots in Ann Arbor. I’ll definitely eat here again.",
