The menu is extremely extensive, it\u2019s almost overwhelming (in a good way) due to all of the options!! Everything around us was cozy and the food others ordered looked great, as well. Would definitely recommend coming if you like sushi or other Asian cuisine.",

The rolls are a great size, definitely not skimpy. Staff was very accommodating, attentive, and friendly. I noticed solo eaters as well as young couples eating comfortably, safe to say it would also be good for small groups.",
