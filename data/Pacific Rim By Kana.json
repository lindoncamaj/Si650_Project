                "description": "Haven't been back here since before the pandemic. Decide to stop in and see how things were going based off some of the menu changes that they had made. I'm so glad that I did. Everything on this menu was amazing. The appetizers were great. Portions were big. Our way to spend a ton of time going over the menu and dealing with some food allergies for us.\n\nI got the peanut butter noodles with the octopus appetizer. Both were amazing. Can't recommend them more. Everything had the perfect amount of heat and prepared hot. Can't wait to come back to this place! Not so much a downside, but you can rack up a pretty high bill pretty fast if you're hitting these advertisers and drinks, so make sure you're paying attention. And a final note, their beer selection was pretty on point as well. Go with any of the stouts that they have available. The won't regret it and a pair great with the noodle dishes",

These photos were taken immediately after the food was placed in front of us. The zucchini was burnt (but only three of them, for some reason, as you can see from the photo). All of our veggies were soggy and mushy (likely because the food had been sitting in the window waiting for a runner, as we waited around for our entrees after the apps for a good 40 minutes). The calamari was good.\n\nOur entire meal took almost 3 hours, and we only got appetizers and entrees for two people. We won't be coming back.",

You definitely need a reservation for Friday night for indoor table. Bathrooms are downstairs which might be a problem if disabled. Pay parking lots nearby",

We were greeted very warmly by the host, he even had the two high chairs set up for us in a nice corner of the restaurant. Being 5 pm, we beat the restaurant week traffic. The server was amazing. Polite, quick and accommodating. The food was fantastic. We had the pork belly for appetizer. The Korean inspired rib eye with quail eggs for main course. And shared a dessert of dark chocolate mousse with passion fruit sabayon sauce. Mouthwatering! Best service ever! They have nice individual restrooms. No diaper changing station but we didn't have an issue with that.",
