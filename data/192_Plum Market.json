My kid thought the chicken tenders were not any better than gas station tenders. The macaroni and cheese lacked flavor, the spinach pie should be named cheese pie for the thick sheet of mozzarella that took over the entire piece. The cabbage soup was tasty, but you can't really mess that up. Will not return, shot over to Panera for better taste and quality for food to go.",
