I Highly recommend dining  in or take out from Zamaan Cafe for authentic Lebanese cuisine.   Mom said the  grape leaves were the best she had ever had eaten. The Tawook chicken was the best chicken I have ever tasted.  Thank you Uncle Ali !!",

This place proves the adage that dives have the best food. No, at your table waitstaff. You order at the counter, and the front counter person brings the food to you.\nMost of the business was as stated, take out, and lots of food was seen exciting the door!  I'd rather have good food with a mediocre atmosphere than bad food with a great atmosphere.  You choose.",

I got the Ginger hummus and Fulful hummus (spicy) and both were outstanding. I enjoyed the falafel wrap and stuffed grape leaves as well. Will definitely have again!",

We both agreed the meat shawarma was good -but the riz di dajaj was HEAVEN! Think chicken shawarma plus garlic sauce plus rice plus a few pickles to cut the fat. I wish we lived closer!
