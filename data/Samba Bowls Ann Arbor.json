I‚Äôve been a couple times and the staff is always friendly, the atmosphere is great, I love their playlists, it‚Äôs like a little slice of Brazil and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm on a little tropical vacation. They have the option to order just the fruits on the side which is an amazing kid-friendly snack for my toddler. And every new flavor I try is better than the next one, I love coming up with different combinations with the build-your-own option. It‚Äôs a MUST TRY if you‚Äôre ever in the area!",

The texture of the a√ßa√≠ is amazing, and isn‚Äôt too watery like ones I‚Äôve had before. I ordered the Bahia Paradise bowl and the powdered milk is really good too. I tried this place a month ago and I still think about how I need to go back. The price is very similar to other places in Ann Arbor if not slightly better. It isn‚Äôt as close as the others are to campus but it‚Äôs a close enough walk that I would 100% recommend going.",

This place is a must-visit for anyone looking for healthy, nutritious, and delicious food and beverages. So, let's dive right in!\nFirst off, I have to say that I would gladly battle the hell of parking in Ann Arbor every day just to eat here! The food is that good. And let me tell you, the ladies who work the counter are absolutely sweet and helpful. It was my first time visiting, and they were more than happy to assist me in making my order. I can't wait to return!\nNow, let's talk about the food. The Samba Bowls are truly a sight to behold. They're packed with fresh fruits, nuts, and other tasty ingredients, and they're so delicious that I'm already planning my next visit. The Metallica Fresh Fruit and Nuts bowl is a personal favorite, and I can't wait to try more of their offerings.\nWhat really sets Samba Bowls apart is their commitment to cleanliness and timely service. I recently visited fairly close to closing time, but I was still greeted with kindness and received perfectly made smoothies. The staff is always kind and helpful, and the atmosphere is always clean and inviting.\nOne of the best parts of Samba Bowls is their unique blend of fresh fruits, nuts, and other tasty ingredients. They're not your typical smoothie, but they're definitely worth trying. The smoothies are made with a combination of fresh fruits, nuts, and other tasty ingredients, and they're absolutely delicious.\nOverall, I highly recommend giving Samba Bowls a try if you're in the Ann Arbor area. The food is fantastic, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is clean and inviting. So, what are you waiting for? Head on over to Samba Bowls and treat yourself to a delicious and nutritious meal!\nThank you so much for joining me on this food adventure!
