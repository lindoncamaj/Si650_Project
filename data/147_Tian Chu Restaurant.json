Prices are most definitely the way they are due to lack of business. The service was a little slow considering we were one of the only people there. The menu was atrociously organized. Would definitely come back, but the restaurant as a whole definitely needs a revamp to keep up with the area. More staff and better atmosphere can definitely shoot this place up to one of the best Chinese restaurants on campus.",

Looks like regular steamed rice, maybe not even washed? I added a photo of a bag of frozen cubed carrots and peas as a comparison of what is in my “fried” rice because I am pretty sure this is exactly what went into my “Taiwanese sausage fried rice” the biggest piece of egg I’ve eaten in this dish was smaller than the hair on my toes. The main selling point of this dish is supposed to be the fancy sounding Taiwanese sausage, however, this is definitely a regular a*s hotdog was maybe toasted in an air fryer in my college dorm. This is the poorest representation of a fried rice dish I have ever seen, and even I could make a more authentic fried rice dish in my run down college house with a budget of 10 dollars.
