Everything was a delight in this restaurant.\nWe shared an appetizer and a main course between the two of us and enjoyed thoroughly. We tried the crab cake appetizer, which had large enough pieces of crab, it had a great texture to it, and came with a side of salad. As a main, the crab stuffed lobster was amazing and the portion was very large. It has mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables as sides. The flavours were incredible.\nService was impecable.\nI highly recommend this place.",

Service was excellent, down to the visit from the GM.\nEach dish served was flavorful and cooked to perfection! Seafood was fresh…crab cakes was not made with a bunch of unnecessary fillers, it was sooo delicious! The salmon was really good as well. They mashed potatoes were just as delicious. The crisp of the rice from my appetizer was really good along with the flavor. We even enjoyed the dessert. As soon as we get back to the area this will be our first stop.",

The food is decent, but in the couple of times we’ve been, someone has been unhappy with their meal. The paella, for example, is underwhelming. It has large chunks of unseasoned, overcooked chicken breast and lacks flavor overall. I got a stuffed salmon that was delicious, but the meal fell flat because it was accompanied by bland steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes. For the price, you can get better seafood elsewhere.",

                "description": "We dined at the bar on Sept 6. The female bartender was friendly and pretty efficient. For the price, I am not sure the food lives up. My dining partner left a good portion of the seafood meal behind. The bread was fresh and hot, but we did have to ask for it. The tenderloin steak was under how I ordered, but it was quite tender. The asparagus was hard and not very flavorful. The bar area had a nice crowd for happy hour and the open window/door area is a nice touch. It feels like a nice place with potential to improve.",
