Every now and then I'll get a doodle from the baristas, which makes my day. While it can be a bit busy around late afternoon, it's worth the wait for a good cup of chai or coffee.",

After a bit of looking around, I decided on Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea to kickstart my engine.  I ordered myself the Roasted Pistachio Latte, with almond milk to make it vegan.  The drink had a really nutty flavor, but softened just enough by the milk to be a lovely, warm sipper to wake up to.\n\nThe atmosphere inside felt just as warm and cozy as the drink in my hand, with local art along the walls and comfortable seats to cradle you close.  By the time I finished my drink and headed out the door I was more than ready for the day.",

Lots of seating options even though it's a small space. Not too crowded either, they did a good job with arranging furniture. The high top seats are not very comfortable though. Overall good space for studying or reading.",
