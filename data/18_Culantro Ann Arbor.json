They are VERY reasonable, and in fact, kinda cheap for AA standards! Both the chicken \ud83d\udc14 and rice \ud83c\udf5a were flavorful and well-seasoned. The trendy decor, brilliant lighting \ud83d\udca1, and Peruvian-themed interior were only added bonuses! Hope to return in the future!!",

I ordered it another day for delivery and it was still great. I can\u2019t stop thinking about this chicken.

                "description": "1st Experience at Culantro: 5 Star Recommended.\n\nI had a delightful exploration of Peruvian flavors in Culantro.\nFrom spicy appetizers to rich, comforting entrees and innovative vegan options, each dish was a testament to the restaurant's commitment to flavor and quality.\n\nAppetizer Delight:\n-Patacones Picantes\nStarting off with Patacones Picantes, the crispy deep-fried banana plantains topped with spicy aji verde and pico de gallo were a vibrant introduction to the meal, offering a delightful mix of sour and spicy notes.\n\nMain Courses to Remember\n\n-Pan Con Pollo\nThe marinated and roasted chicken sandwich, enhanced with salsa criolla and served with fries, was a comforting blend of flavors, demonstrating the magic of simple, well-executed dishes.\n\n-Carne a La Plancha\nThis dish featured a well-done steak topped with an egg and served with an array of sides, including the standout chimichurri sauce that added a fresh, herby dimension to the meal.\n\n-Tallarin Verde Vegan\nA testament to the restaurant's versatility, this vegan spaghetti tossed in a rich, flavorful sauce with saut\u00e9ed veggies and portobello mushrooms proved that plant-based dishes could dazzle the palate just as much as any meat dish.",

Esp recommend the Culantro Bowl if you are looking for bold vibrant flavors and the Aji de Gallina if you want something savory and comforting. Both juices we had were also delicious and refreshing. The whole time we were there it was packed with a line to the door and I can see why. 5 stars",

                "description": "Good food but a little lackluster. If you get the Pan con Pollo ask for extra sauce because it was dry. The Lomo Saltado was too salty LOL. Portion sizes are also pretty small. The actual restaurant is really small and it\u2019s order at the booth and they don\u2019t really have a system so when you walk in make sure to snag a table and then go order.",
