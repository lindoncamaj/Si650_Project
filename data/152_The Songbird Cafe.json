One day I came in for a takeout order, and they gave me this lovely card alongside my order. This is the kind of customer service that builds loyalty. I feel guilty that I’ll be taking a job in a different city and won’t have reason to visit Ann Arbor as often or this lovely cafe for lunch for much longer, but please know that I will always return when I’m in the area, and greatly appreciate everyone who works here.",

                "description": "I wanted to try this place out so I gave it a shot. When I walked in there was a menu on a chalkboard wall. I walked up to the counter to order and two gals were discussing a problem at the register. The one said she was going to take my order and they could finish the conversation when she was done, but the other one wasn’t listening and just kept talking. She had to cut her off and say she was going to take my order, which I’m glad for because I really didn’t want to keep waiting while they hashed that out.\nI ordered a Northside BLT with homemade chips, pickle and an m&m cookie. It cost close to $18.00, which I feel is pretty high for a sandwich/chips/cookie. I did enjoy the sandwich, having avocado on it. The chips were quite good as well. I would come back here and meet a friend for lunch. There’s a pretty large dining area for sitting too.",

Ordered the lemon pesto chicken salad on a brioche bun today and this was DELICIOUS! 😋 also, tried the dirty taro latte... it was good but did not taste sweet like the taro bubble tea you'll find. The bacon BLT sandwich plus their homemade chips hit the spot too!\n\nSept 2022\nUpdate - Iced ginger tea was excellent and a cup of hot tumeric ginger tea was enjoyed by my friend. Good for the immune system too!\n\nGreat food, lattes, and atmosphere for meeting up with friends, colleagues and clients. Plenty of space to work too.\n\nHad the pistachio turkey sandwich today, which was good, but the bacon pesto grilled cheese was divine! All the flavors blended well together. Don't forget to order a side of their homemade chips.\n\nCheck out their omelettes too!\n\nMy friend always gets the lavender latte, and I had the rosemary salted caramel latte today. Both are great.",
