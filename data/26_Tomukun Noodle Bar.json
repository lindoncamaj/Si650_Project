The waitstaff (a lady and a men)hurried us to place our order, brought us iced water without asking if we wanted it, and seemed more focused on getting us to finish and leave rather than providing a pleasant dining experience. They even rushed us through the checkout process and were quick to clear our table before we were done.\n\nPlus, even if the service is bad, there is a 18% gratuity‚Ä¶\n\nOverall, it felt like they were more interested in turning over tables than ensuring a good experience for their customers.

The shrimp tempura buns were very good and so was the green curry udon. Okokomiyaki is really really good however it CANNOT be an appetizer/starter because it's massive and heavy. The worst of all was the spicy chicken ramen. The chicken was not at all spicy and felt unseasoned. The broth was diluted so much that you couldn't taste it one bit.
