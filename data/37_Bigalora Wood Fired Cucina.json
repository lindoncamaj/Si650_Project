Anything I tried never wowed me but it was delicious enough to go back. Bur I live the many seating options both in summer and winter. Really spacious and nice atmosphere, good for big groups. One problem is they donâ€™t split checks. They say they take multiple payments but it becomes way to complicated and we always end up paying each our companies.",

The pistachio pesto is the perfect pairing! Extra done with red pepper flakes easily made this the best pizza I've had.\nThe funghi pizza was meh. I added caramelized onion and zucchini to mine. It's missing something and I'm just not sure what. I had ordered red sauce on the side but sadly got food to go and it wasn't included.\nThe soup was not great. Very bland. Definitely not worth the price. Also container was half empty...\nTiramisu was solid and a decent sized piece. I'm very happy with it. Very fresh tasting. Strong coffee flavor that was extremely pleasantly balanced with the cream.",

The salad was great, healthy and fibrous and filling, with a flavorful light dressing. The pizza toppings weren't as integrated into the pizza as I personally would prefer but they were quality ingredients and the dough was DELICIOUS. The Brussels didn't look the most appetizing but they were honestly the best I've ever had in a restaurant.",
