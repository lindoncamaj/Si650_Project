The crust was so hard it could neither break it into pieces with my hands nor bite through it. Gluten free crust is pretty much always drier and harder than regular crust, it should never go into the over for too long. Do not come here for the gf pizzas. I could only eat the somewhat edible parts although it was still difficult to chew. Photo included.",

The pistachio pesto is the perfect pairing! Extra done with red pepper flakes easily made this the best pizza I've had.\nThe funghi pizza was meh. I added caramelized onion and zucchini to mine. It's missing something and I'm just not sure what. I had ordered red sauce on the side but sadly got food to go and it wasn't included.\nThe soup was not great. Very bland. Definitely not worth the price. Also container was half empty...\nTiramisu was solid and a decent sized piece. I'm very happy with it. Very fresh tasting. Strong coffee flavor that was extremely pleasantly balanced with the cream.",

The salad was great, healthy and fibrous and filling, with a flavorful light dressing. The pizza toppings weren't as integrated into the pizza as I personally would prefer but they were quality ingredients and the dough was DELICIOUS. The Brussels didn't look the most appetizing but they were honestly the best I've ever had in a restaurant.",
