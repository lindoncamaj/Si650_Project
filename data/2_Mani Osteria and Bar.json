We ordered shrimp scampi (6 large shrimp, $18) and pizza with red onions, pistachios, and goat cheese. Pizza was thin-crust, baked just perfectly, cut in 6 large slices, well enough for 2 people ($18). For dessert, we had cannolis (3 with different fillings, $7) and coffee (free, a nice surprise!). The restaurant is in a nice neighborhood. Street parking is available nearby, free after 6pm and on Sundays.",

Each dish was good size portion.  We ordered several foods and shared.  Love the restaurant atmosphere and great place with your friends, family, coworkers, and someone special.  They don't take a reservation, so it better to be there with extra time.",
