The food is simply amazing, with the tacos and tamales standing out as personal favorites. The tacos are packed with flavor, and the tamales are perfectly cooked with a delightful filling. The service is impressively quick, and the staff is always friendly, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. The added bonus of a patio allows for a pleasant outdoor meal, and free parking makes the visit hassle-free. If you’re in Ann Arbor, Chela’s should definitely be on your list!",

                "description": "Food was nice and warm when I picked it up. Everything was correct. First thing I noticed was the green salsa I paid for was only filled to 1/2 of the container. Tacos (should) come with salsa already, so paying for an empty container is a rip off.\n\nThe carne asada tacos were decent; the meat was a bit tough and no salt. They come with one lime and a measly bunch of cilantro and onion.\n\nThe pork tamale was something I would not get again. Moist but no taste at all. It is lacking any type of salt; don’t be fooled by the green sauce inside, that’s also flavorless!\n\nThe items unfortunately only had flavor when I dumped hot salsa all over them. As a Mexican-American, this place does not serve quality food. I’d rather make the drive to Detroit for authentic and fair priced Mexican food! Primos Tacos is my favorite spot. It was worth a try.",
