But anything that can be pre-packaged or frozen, I would avoid.\n\nPros: a wide menu of Korean food classics, bar style seating is fun\n\nCons: a little pricey for what it is, not the greatest quality",

This is a nice and clean little shop with a homey atmosphere. We were helped by the most attentive waitress, who made sure we were well served even though she seems very busy. We ordered a rich gal bi and a kimchi jigae soup, both were so authentic and comforting, not to mention the refillable ban chan that were also very delicious! Highly recommend this place, we will definitely come back again in the future. Thank you so much for having us!",
