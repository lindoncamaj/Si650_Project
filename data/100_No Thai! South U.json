They don\u2019t seem super enthusiastic about their job but they aren\u2019t rude or off putting in any way. No Thai is a good once a week lunch for me since it\u2019s really expensive now. I remember when a Pad Thai Curry and spring rolls was under $15. Now it\u2019s $20+ and they throw that tip request at you when paying by card. Hopefully their quality and consistency gets a little better someday but it\u2019s been this way for years so I\u2019m not expecting that to really ever happen.",
