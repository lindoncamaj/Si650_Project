                "description": "Great smoked meat!  I love finding these little out of the way places!  Turkey has great smoked flavor.  I often encounter this meat too dry with only a hint of smoked flavor, but this is juicy and full of flavor!  Sausage is delicious, and the brisket is wonderful without being too fatty.  Normally I don‚Äôt like the sauce too sweet, but despite being on the sweeter side, it has a nice light tang with a little bite to even out the sweetness.  Pinto beans were good, but could have used a hint of salt to taste.  Toast could have used a touch of warm butter when served, but I also arrived at the end of the day.  Service was polite and prompt.  Overall excellent bbq.  My biggest problem is fighting off a food coma getting back on the road.",
