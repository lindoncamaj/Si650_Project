                "description": "My boyfriend and I were looking for a good burger place in Ann Arbor and stumbled upon Taystee\u2019s Burgers in our search. We were pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu and plethora of options. We dined in on a Sunday and I would have definitely gotten a chicken wrap if they weren\u2019t only available on Tuesdays. I got the BBQ burger on a gluten free bun and my boyfriend did a Build Your Own grilled chicken sandwich and loaded it up with his favorite toppings. We also shared a Cajun curly fry, and besides the fact that there was a heavy amount of seasoning on them we still enjoyed our side. We were in Ann Arbor for my birthday and live in Metro Detroit. We will definitely be visiting one of the other locations closer to home.",

We purchased 7 different burgers and cut them up to share.  Now they loose their presentation that way but we all get a couple good size bites of each burger.  I liked both the Mushroom Swiss and the Taystees Volcano Burger.  My wife enjoyed the Mac-Attack, the Boys liked the Taystees Volcano Burger, Nacho Burger and Breakfast Burger.  My Daughter voted for the Breakfast Burger.   Great Food! Great Service, Great Price.  Taystee Burger is only $9.50, the Breakfast Burger is $16 but it is huge.   I love this place and have been to multiple locations and now my wife and kids love it too.   Great job AJ.  Taystees made the list.",

The guy at the register took the time to give us a rundown of the entire menu which I thought was really awesome of him. He was educated on the entire menu and it made it super easy for my fianc\u00e9e and I to choose what we wanted. We both typically have basic tastes but the entire menu looked delicious. Got a single burger with just cheese and it\u2019s  the best burger I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I\u2019m currently writing this review while eating it because I didn\u2019t want to forget to give these guys the credit they deserve. Top notch service and top notch food.

The staff were serving me with a smile and the restaurant has these huge glass windows to let a lot of light in. They also have a lot of options; gluten free bun, vegan patties, a variety of toppings. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a  good quality burger for that late night burger craving. 5/5",
