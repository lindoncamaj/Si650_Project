Went at 12 on a Wednesday and there was enough space for us. We dined in and got seated right away with our food being delivered very quickly after placing orders. I got the chicken shawarma with 2 sides, the salad and hummus and 2 falafel patties. The chicken shawarma was soooo good. It came with a yogurt almost tzatziki like sauce and was cool and refreshing to match the amazing seasoned chicken. It was served with some brown rice that was amazingly done (4/5). The salad was refreshing and had some toasted pita bread on it for a crunch and was perfect for the summer heat (4/5). The hummus was one of the best hummus I've ever had, perfect in its taste (5/5). Lastly, the falafel patties, they were a bit crunchy and done on the outside but it was still so good when you get to he flavor in the middle (3.5/5). Lastly, couldn't leave without the dessert, pistachio baklava. This was so delicious and flaky. The amount of sweetness matched with the pistachio saltyness, one if the best baklava I've had (4.5/5). The atmosphere matches the food perfectly and service was friendly, would def visit again!",
