Known especially for their fish tacos, the seafood options are consistently fresh and expertly done.  We had a group gathering in their private room on Halloween.\n\nThere's an option to sit indoors or on the patio, and live music kicks in after 9:00 p.m., which adds to the lively ambiance. They’re open later on weekends, so it’s a great spot to wind down or keep the night going. Call ahead or book online, especially if you’re going during prime hours.",

The atmosphere was cool and fun.  I liked the outdoor seating arrangement.\n\nThe food was phenomenal:\nMy dad ordered the weekly special, which was the hangar wagyu steak. He shared a bite with me, and it was out of this world! I think he was quiet most of the meal because he was so absorbed in the flavor of the steak.\nMy mom ordered the salmon, and she was very happy with it. The salsa sauce complimented it really well. I also think it was the most beautifully presented.\nI enjoyed the red snapper!  The quinoa was also very flavorful and rich. I don't know how they did that because I usually find quinoa bland and dry. The plantains were another showstopping highlight. They were absolutely perfect. Crispy caramelized outside, melt in your mouth inside. They were flavorful, just the right level of sweetness, and not at all starchy.\n\nWe were very pleased with our experience here. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially if you have a special occasion.",

The salmon was spicy but so good. I also had the seasonal salad and the unique combination  of mango with peppers, pomegranate seeds and almonds was so yummy and freshening. In addition to the food and great service the drinks are hands down my favorite. The last straw-berry is a perfect blend of tart with a kiss of sweetness.

The Crab Rangoon dip was AMAZING! The wontons were fresh but I wish they came out warm. But so good. We split the surf and turf pasta and OMG I would get that time and time again.",
