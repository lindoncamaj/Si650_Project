My husband and I went on \"Treat Yourself Tuesday\" for honestly the best deal in Ann Arbor: a NY strip served with two sides, house or caesar salad, & dessert for $30! We were STUFFED and the food was amazing. Everyone here is super friendly and we were seated in one of the cozy booths. Our first kiss almost exactly 5 years ago was actually in the Down Bar which can get kind of wild late at night if you're into that (we are boring and old now so that's not really our vibe anymore).",

We had to ask for ketchup for our fries after to walked away.\nThe menu is limited, I would like to see more options.",

Happy hour is 4-6, half off drafts, signature cocktails, and appetizers. Definitely on my list to go back for dinner to check out the food. I was meeting up with a friend who doesn't eat shellfish and this place had a ton on the menu. Another bummer is the lack of N/A non-alcoholic options. They had two N/A beers, but no N/A cocktails. It'd be nice if at least one of their signature cocktails had a N/A spirit like Dhos or Seedlip.",

                "description": "Perfect place for dinner in downtown Ann Arbor! The place is ideally located in the heart of downtown where you have the option to sit both indoor as well as outdoor. They have really good deep dish Detroit style pizzas on the menu and a fine collection of beers! The food and service both are very good! Strongly recommended!\nThey removed the Cauliflower starters from their menu which was a little letdown.",

Portions run on the smaller side, but we just got a few appetizers to share. Their drink menu has a lot to offer and they have a full bar so you can still order your favorites",
