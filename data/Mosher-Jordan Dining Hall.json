There is also, always, someone on staff just in case someone does get locked out of the room.  The Hill (which is where this dorm is located, among others) is in a very convenient location.  It is in walking distance from the bus stops, downtown Ann Arbor, Hospital, and the CCRB (Campus Gym).  I highly recommend this location for incoming freshmen or sophomore, until the become better acquainted with the Umich Campus.",

That coworker knew my friend is a student so she exercised her “authority” to put her on the weak spot by constantly judging her food plating speed and waiting to blame her for any slightest imperfection she made. This coworker eventually caught my friend taking an empty plate from another student who demanded separate food and called over a chef to back her up and blamed my friend for doing everything wrong and presenting a “bad attitude.” While my friend had listened to her coworker’s every suggestion without any disagreement, this coworker continued to scold and swear at my friend when she left the food serving station, saying that my friend better leave because she’s having “a bad a** attitude.” While my friend was working here, she was always being watched and judged by the full-time workers who seemed to have nothing to do but commenting on new student workers. It’s such a terrible working atmosphere, and the food tastes bland and not worth the bucks portion wise.",
