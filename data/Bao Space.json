                "description": "I grew up in Ann Arbor, and I still come back once in a while since I left more than 15 years ago.  I like the joints back in the days because they offered good quality food, though old school.  Now everything is just trendy and mediocre.\nThis is a cramped little joint.  Clean.  It was Ann Arbor Air Fair weekend, the joint was at about 60% capacity.  They ran out of the popular Pork Bao and the Hot and Sour soup, maybe those could've helped my rating but too bad.  They ran out before noon, how is it possible?   They make the Bao continuously in the open kitchen.\nI had the Beef and Onion Bao and the Shrimp Bao, the meat core was OK, you can taste the MSG, the dough had the right chew and density.  But they are not $3.50 - $4.00 ea. good.  They are slightly better than the frozen ones you can buy from the Chinese supermarket.  I saw some people even compared this to Ding Tai Fung, I feel bad for people who are still suffering from taste lost post COVID.\nThe most disappointing items are the miso soup and the rice bowls.  Both the braised pork and the braised beef were just OK, nothing like what they should be.  The flavors are too bland, the servings are small for the costs, but you do get a ton of semi-hard rice with it.   The miso soup was absolutely revolting.  It is just miso with some hot water, sea weed and tofu, absolutely no flavor and taste water down.  I had instant miso soup from the convenient store better than that.  Over all,  these food items are cafeteria quality.\nNo alcohol here, just some soft drinks.  I simply cannot give it more than 3 stars.",

The food was definitely good despite being a little salty, but portion size was small and the bill was big. Strangely it was the cheapest ingredients that they were cheap on, like rice and vegetables. The rice bowl had 3 baby bok choy leaves and about a half a cup of cooked rice 😬. The boa where good, but $3.50 to $4.00 a piece for an ounce of meat/veg in rice bun. Rice is Cheap!!!!!!  Anyways with 3 whole employees they might want to through another boa in, a little more rice/veg and they might have more than a small handful of tables at lunch directly across the street from every municipal building for the city of Ann Arbor.",

The sesame noodles are great as well. Don’t forget to get a drink, even though it’s not their speciality, they have good boba that’s worth a try. It’s a open space as well with outside seating.",
