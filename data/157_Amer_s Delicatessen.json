Super friendly staff and great food. I had Pastrami Reuben on Pumpernickel and wife had BLT with Turkey. We split fries.  Really enjoyed the Sammie’s.  Will be back for sure.",

I told this twice to the guy that handed me my food. But he didn’t listen to me and I gave up. They were excellent fries, fried appropriately and crispy.\nThe sandwich had chicken, pesto, cheese and a tomato on it. It was okay. The chicken and the tomato needed salt. There was a large portion of chicken and cheese on the sandwich. The amount of tomato and pesto on the sandwich were comparatively small. Bread was good. Sandwich was very large, pictured is 1/4 of the sandwich.\nThey did include both sweet and dill pickles with the sandwich, which was nice.",

I got one of the club sandwiches with both pastrami and corned beef; it was great! $17 felt a little expensive, but the sandwich was easily big enough for two people to share.

He took the time to explain all the different menu boards, gave suggestions, had knowledge of all the going-ons around town, and just a super helpful person.\nThe food was fantastic.  Ordered a #83 and a #76. Both sandwiches were stacked with turkey and had excellent toppings. The bread was fresh and tasty.  They have a great selection of vegetarian items, too.\nWe'll definitely be back.",
