I came with my nephew and sister and we were all surprised at the prices vs the portion sizes! Being from Atlanta I was expecting smaller portions but they go big here!\n\nI got the Fat Daddy Sandwich and was so excited to eat it and almost burnt my tongue. The chicken was freshly fried and dressed to order. I dug into the delicious cheese fries while I waited for my sandwich to cool. Pairing it all with the fried pickles just competed the whole meal.\n\nSmall area to dine in, mainly waiting space, but it was a slow evening and we decided to hang out. If im in the area i would definitely visit again.",

(10 tenders today are equivalent to 5-6 tenders from less then a year ago)\nI understand and know food costs have gone up but to raise the prices and then lower the quality and portions sizes at the same time is a little ridiculous. Itâ€™s unfortunate because it seems this is another place that over expanded and then cared more about profits then anything else.",

So first the chicken sandwich was disgusting. It had weird flavors and the maple syrup through it off even more. The wings smelled and lacked flavor. The oil I think needed to be changed. The catfish nuggets were even more disgusting. It had no flavor and had a rubber texture. Even their homemade sauce was terrible which only consisted of mayo and ketchup. The only good thing was the coke even the fries weren't good. My son stomach was hurting. Please don't waste your time or your\nmoney here.",

                "description": "Delicious! We got the family meal with 10 mild chicken tenders, cheese fries, and Mac and cheese. It was so much food! Great deal! Everything was super flavorful. The Mac and cheese was nice and peppery. The cheese fries look like plain cheese fries but the seasoning was so good! The chicken although mild was very well seasoned. The pickles on top gave them a nice salt and vinegar taste too. I would definitely come back. Wish it was closer to me!",
