                "description": "Getting it hot and dining in was the best choice. We spent roughly $38 and some change on cheese bread and a half and half pizza which was traditional pep and supreme w/o mushroom. The cheese bread was so stringy and was ok, not as flavorful as it could have been. The pizza was decent, the traditional pep was good and recommended.  As you chewed/ate more of a slice, it was as though the pizza wasn't cooked all the way, like borderline doughy.",

                "description": "So, two friends and I had to make a trip up to Ann Arbor for a funeral this weekend and after being in the car for almost five hours, we decided just to order in. The concensus landed on pizza, because why not?! So instead of getting something from a larger chain, we opted for Cottage Inn. Let me just say that we were ECSTATIC we did! Happy pizza dances were had!\n\nWe did a split, round, medium pizza with breadsticks and two oreo shakes. The breadsticks are SO GOOD!! We're partial to soft, doughy, garlicky breadsticks so if you're not in that club, you won't like these. If you are, you'll LOVE them! The buttery goodness lifted our spirits.\n\nFor our pizza, we split half with pepperoni and feta, the other half sausage and onion, with mushrooms on the whole thang. The veggies are under the cheese, which was more than abundant and gooey and overall the topping ratio was impressive. Now, the shakes were a random move but turned out to be a great decision. I called ahead to see what the dirty shamrock consisted of, so if you're curious it's chocolate and mint. But yes, the shakes were delicious as well. If there were a Cottage Inn near us in Indianapolis, consider me a return customer.\n\nWe were staying at the Wyndham hotel nearby and our driver actually called to ensure he was able to find us. He delivered to our room! Which is such a small, but nice gesture that saved us some convenience. So big thank you to our driver for that extra effort.\n\nFood can make or break your night and we were already having a rough one, so the fact that Cottage Inn delivered quickly and our order was not only accurate, but delicious made our night much better. 10/10 recommend.",
