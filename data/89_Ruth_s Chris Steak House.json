                "description": "We have been enjoying Ruth Chris for many years. This year we went for my birthday 8/3. My husband likes to eat dinner early so we were the first table to be seated this day. We enjoyed an appetizer with the yummy bread and I had a delicious salad. We also tried the bottle water and the tap water we couldn\u2019t tell the difference. We ordered dinner and sides and were pleased with our food. This is when everything went bad. Our empty plates sat in front of us for 25 minutes. I even asked for them to be removed and a dessert menu brought out to us. At this point I went downstairs to the hostess area and asked for a manager. Ashley was the manager and I told her I was upset that the plates had not been removed and no dessert menu brought to us.  We felt that our waitress was busy with a large table and was not finishing with our table and another two top in the room that was experiencing the same problems. I also said I was disappointed that a manager had not stopped by our table to check on how our dinner was. Ashley\u2019s replay was that she had not had time to get upstairs yet to check on tables. Remember we were the first to be seated and this was over 2 hours later! Very disappointing! She did say what can I do for you. I said I just wanted someone to know of our disappointment with our dining experience. I went to the restroom and when I came back Ashley was at the top of the stairs and the plates were removed from our table. Our waitress brought out a treat for my birthday a small strawberry cheesecake with a candle, nice presentation. She also put 3 forks out for everyone at the table to have a bite. She asked for my ID for the birthday discount. I\u2019m guessing she had to so see Ashley regarding the discount because after the bill was brought to us Ashley came by saying \u201cyou didn\u2019t tell me it was your Birthday\u201d. I guess that was our manager visit. We were never asked if anyone else wanted dessert. We left there saying we are not coming back and went to Culver\u2019s for ice cream. Funny thing a employee at Culver\u2019s stopped at our table and wanted to know how our ice cream was and if we needed anything. I just expected much more from Ruth Chris Steak House \u2639\ufe0f.",

I had the ribeye steak cooked medium, and it was very good, but not the best steak I\u2019ve eaten. We added the trio of sauces and really enjoyed the cremini mushroom one. The lobster Mac and cheese was topped with nice chunks of lobster, while the au gratin potatoes were thick cut, but not enough cheese. It seemed to have mayo which dominated the sauce mixture. We also ordered Brussel sprouts which were nicely done. Finally was the dessert which we enjoyed the chocolate, flourless mini cakes. Our server was Jessica and she was exceptional!",

The crab cakes were great for the Midwest, but just okay if you\u2019ve ever had crab cakes from the coasts. The steamed broccoli was exactly how I like it: plain, with a crunch, no seasonings or butter. If you want \u201cflavorful\u201d veggies, that\u2019s not this. The shrimp was very well seasoned but it did arrive cold. I had the sweet potato casserole without pecans and it was absolutely delicious. Imagine a velvety pie filling with carmelized sugar. Paired well with the Mac. They give you a whole loaf of warm bread with whipped butter. To drink I had the cucumber gimlet and a French 75. It was super lovely and welcoming, I\u2019m looking forward to coming back. My biggest suggestion would be to have a better happy hour menu, and some music.",

The waiter was very nice, he explained how Ruth\u2019s Chris cooks there food which I found to be interesting. We tried there ribeye steak, as well as the lamb chops, and both were amazing. The asparagus was good, not soggy at all and it came with a butter sauce that made it even better. I didn\u2019t care for their Mac and cheese, it was quite bland, I wouldn\u2019t order it again. Their crab cakes were also good, worth trying. We went to celebrate our anniversary and the waiter surprised us with a cheesecake to share as our dessert.

This is my first time trying Ruth's Chris steakhouse and it did not disappoint. We had the shrimp cocktail to start and the shrimp were huge and fresh. I had the 16 oz NY strip and it was just plain delicious, cooked exactly how I wanted. Bursting with flavor and very tender for a strip. Garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus were the perfect pairing for side dishes. Our waitress Amanda was awesome. She was very helpful and helped my girlfriend pick out the perfect wine to pair with her steak (filet mignon) . We were celebrating our anniversary and they gave us a complimentary cheese cake. I also ordered creme brulee for myself and it was very well done. Creamy and luscious. The atmosphere was nice, upscale but not pretentious. good lighting and clean. Overall a great experience. I recommend.",

This visit we ordered the sweet potato dish to go with the steak, and it was *out of this world*! We almost ordered a 2nd one... it was that divine! It had this amazing pecan pie crust and pecans and cinnamon sprinkled all over the top... OMG! My husband and I couldn't get enough! The steak was cooked and seasoned just perfectly. The shoestring fries are an absolute must... super thin and crispy! Everything about our meal was sublime.\nAnd then, before our lovely server brought the check, she presented us with the \"Happy Anniversary Cheesecake\" compliments of the restaurant! Not many establishments will do anything like that anymore... just goes to show what a step above Ruth's Chris is \ud83d\udcaf",
