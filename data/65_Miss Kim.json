There are multiple options for me as a Vegan, the Silken Tofu Fried is delicious, you can choose sweet to medium to spicy, my spicy choice was DELICIOUS. The appetizers were delicious, I’ve had some issues with broccolini this Summer and this dish instantly restored my faith! The char was balanced flavor and crunch, we got two sauces on the side so the Vegans had an option, we all loved this. The mushroom noodle dish was split by all of us, with subtle murmurs of enjoyment as each person tried it. The meat eaters LOVED their dishes, they looked good before they disappeared in a swirl of metal chopsticks. Yes, I can’t wait to return and get the tofu sandwich!!! Note: service was great, friendly and prompt.",

The sandwich just burst with flavour, and was honestly solid. The shredded carrot appetizer was also just so rich. The staff here were incredibly friendly and the overall ambiance was just calm and relaxed.\n\nThe prices over here are a little steep, and part of me wished the portion sizes were slightly larger.\nBut an overall great experience otherwise.",

In the same thread, the tteokbokki also has a crispy outside and a moist inside for the rice cakes, although the flavor could use more punch.\n\nThen the rest of the dishes had no punch. The kalbi was lacking in caramelization (so no deep sweet taste) and marination (so no deep salty taste). The little gem lettuce had too much fruit that contrasted with the expectation of a leafy side. The kimchi was softer and felt older. Same for the carrot salad.\n\nSo a chance at highlights but in the end not to the standard of solid Korean fare.",

Also, I must say this is a perfect place to introduce others to Asian food without being too adventurous!\n\nSmashed potatoes are a must get! So crispy and the seasoning is sweet and salty.\n\nTteokbokki which is rice cakes with a soy sauce base. The mushrooms with asparagus went very well with the dish!\n\nDuck was very tender! Watermelon radish was very refreshing.\n\nFriend chicken-The meat was fried so well and very tender/juicy. I do wish it had more spice to it!",
