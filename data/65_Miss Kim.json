There are multiple options for me as a Vegan, the Silken Tofu Fried is delicious, you can choose sweet to medium to spicy, my spicy choice was DELICIOUS. The appetizers were delicious, I\u2019ve had some issues with broccolini this Summer and this dish instantly restored my faith! The char was balanced flavor and crunch, we got two sauces on the side so the Vegans had an option, we all loved this. The mushroom noodle dish was split by all of us, with subtle murmurs of enjoyment as each person tried it. The meat eaters LOVED their dishes, they looked good before they disappeared in a swirl of metal chopsticks. Yes, I can\u2019t wait to return and get the tofu sandwich!!! Note: service was great, friendly and prompt.",

The sandwich just burst with flavour, and was honestly solid. The shredded carrot appetizer was also just so rich. The staff here were incredibly friendly and the overall ambiance was just calm and relaxed.\n\nThe prices over here are a little steep, and part of me wished the portion sizes were slightly larger.\nBut an overall great experience otherwise.",

In the same thread, the tteokbokki also has a crispy outside and a moist inside for the rice cakes, although the flavor could use more punch.\n\nThen the rest of the dishes had no punch. The kalbi was lacking in caramelization (so no deep sweet taste) and marination (so no deep salty taste). The little gem lettuce had too much fruit that contrasted with the expectation of a leafy side. The kimchi was softer and felt older. Same for the carrot salad.\n\nSo a chance at highlights but in the end not to the standard of solid Korean fare.",
