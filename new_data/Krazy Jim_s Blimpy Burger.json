There will likely be a line but that is to be expected when everyone wants to eat here.\n\nFood: Absolutely sensational! üåü The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. I love burgers cooked no a flattop. Every bite was a taste explosion that lived up to the hype. I tried the double with a fried egg and the onion rings ‚Äì both were out of this world! üçî\n\nAtmosphere: The vibe here is super fun and laid-back. Perfect spot to hang out with friends or family. Limited seating so get in early.\n\nIf you're in Ann Arbor, make sure Krazy Jim‚Äôs Blimpy Burger is on your list! Trust me, you won't regret it. üòã",

                "description": "First time having this place actually was pretty delicious, the pricing seems to be a little off but hey everything is somewhat expensive now a days. I got the peppersteak bomber and large onion rings with the Orange dream beverage (orange dreamcicle) and it came up to about 20 bucks. Although it seems to be a bit much to have a triple burger, the size of the patties justify the portion by the buns being super thick. Also the onion rings and fried veggies are great but comes with the chore of have to separate every bit you take from them being clumped together. Overall this place is like a local five guys  a nice hole in the wall spot with fresh components not including the Nostalgia surrounding the old skool tables and Stools.",
