We ordered waffle fries with bacon and ranch. We also got the poutine. Both were great but the poutine came in a little bowl. I thought it would have been larger, but it was still very tasty. The bathrooms are downstairs. They have outdoor seating. Their draft beer selection is large. I had a Carmel apple cider. It was delicious! The atmosphere is fun and easy going. It's definitely a fun place to go after a Michigan game. The manager was very nice to us and the staff was also friendly. They also have TV's everywhere.",
