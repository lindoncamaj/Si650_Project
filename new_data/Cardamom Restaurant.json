All the waiters are so nice, I felt so bad last time we visited since we got there maybe 20-30 minutes before the kitchen closed, but everyone who worked there was so nice about it. The mattar paneer is to die for, I get it literally every single time I go. Super cute atmosphere too, and there usually isn't too much of a wait which is nice. The naan is also so delicious. And the amount of food is great, I almost always have a bit of leftovers for the next day which I love.",

The cheesecake reminded me of “Shreekhand” - which is a traditional Indian dessert popular in the state of Maharashtra. I’m originally from Maharashtra, so when I had the first bite it took me home- so thanks to the Chef!!  I really loved this interesting take on cheesecake. Momos were just perfect! Tandoori chicken was well balanced with spices. Overall it was good experience and I’ll definitely go back to try some other dishes.",

That could be overlooked if the food was of decent quality, but the dishes were subpar. I ordered the vegetable biryani, one of my favorite Indian dishes, and in comparison to other biryanis that I have tried this one was very bland. The Indian spices didn’t stand out, I couldn’t taste any anise or mint (which is a staple to the dish), and the overall texture/ appearance wasn’t quite right. There are plenty of other great Indian restaurants around the Ann Arbor area so I feel no need to return to this one again.",
