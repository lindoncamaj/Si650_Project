Nice atmosphere and friendly people, but I especially liked the healthy options.  They serve breakfast and lunch.  I ordered the beet burger with their house potatoes.  Their burger sauce was delicious. .  Gluten-free options are available as well.  Everything tasted fresh and homemade.\n\nThey also have a full coffee bar and a selection of smoothies.  Highly recommend.",

That’s a first for me because I always have to ask for extra crispy in restaurants. 2) The customer service sign on the wall (see photo). 3) service with a smile. Even the person who wasn’t directly our weight staff.",

The poor family sitting near us though they had gluten free pancakes, since that is advertised all over the restaurant, but after assuring the customer that the ‘whole wheat’ they used was somehow gluten free, the server realized the mistake. Scary for someone with celiac! The Thai peanut wrap I got was really good, but the chips and guac tasted store bought.",

The near fully open restaurant gave you insight to how things were prepped, and it was fresh, delivered straight to you steaming hot. It was busy, so we didn't get many touch points with our waitress - if we didn't know what we wanted, if she stopped by, we wouldn't see her again. Yet, that doesn't take away from a great breakfast experience where we ealked away super full and content.",
