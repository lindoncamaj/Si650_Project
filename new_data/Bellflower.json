                "description": "This is the most sophisticated date or special occasion restaurant in Ypsilanti. I've had one or two dinners here that I didn't love, but last night, my whole party loved the meals, including dessert. The perch I had was perfection. My friends loved their vegetable curry, and we all enjoyed the bread pudding w whipped cream dessert. The menu changes often, if not daily. While hard-core foodies might notice errors on some things, like not detaching the oyster from the shell, it's still a place one can get oysters in Ypsi that taste good. The atmosphere is terrific. The service last night was perfect. Be prepared for a big bill, but sometimes it is worth it to have a fancy evening out.",

Seafood chowder, Great lakes fish cakes served two different ways and Breaded perch. Portions were perfect. Amazed at the delicious dishes that are created with what's on hand and what's in season. Love that the menu is a surprise. What a fabulous gem In Ypsilanti Michigan!",

Our service stated that he was Japanese and was very knowledgeable about the food preparation and process by which it was shipped to the restaurant, prepared,humanely delivered, the flight timing and everything in between it being on our plate. The atmosphere was chic and very clean. We sat outside in a very creative pergola type of area. Oh, even the bread is made from scratch. If I could have eaten the plate, I would have. I will definitely be a regular after how impressed I have been with this first visit.",

It went together deliciously and the catfish was very light, flaky, battered so delicately.\nI tried the tuna appetizer and it was absolutely amazing! We will be eating there again soon.\n(My only negative, in our opinion, is that if you are not an alcohol consumer, you may not get as much attention from the waitress when you need her, as opposed to those who do choose to indulge.)",

Drink selections are limited to canned or bottled choices or wine/beer/cocktails. We had the Italian sandwich and salad with deep fried tofu and both were delicious.",
