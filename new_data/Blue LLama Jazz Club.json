                "description": "Great place for food and live music, there's nothing else like it in Ann Arbor. That said, I was a bit disappointed by a few parts of the experience. We got the tasting menu, and while everything was good, nothing really stood out. There are much better places to get innovative and delicious food in town. The service was fairly attentive, but definitely erred on the side of smothering. I think the waitress asked how we were enjoying the entree dish 3 separate times like 5 minutes apart. It's not a cheap place, and I was prepared for that, but I still felt like I was being nickeled and dimed at every turn. From extra charges for more chips, to a credit card fee on the bill, they just kept digging for more money. I asked for a different dessert than the one on the tasting menu, and they charged me for the full thing. And didn't even give me the included dessert I had already paid for! All of that is on top of the cover charge too. Overall I did have a good experience - mostly due to the fantastic music - and I will probably come back at some point, but if Blue Llama wants to compete with the other high end establishments in town, they really need to step up their game.",

The Blue Llama has now set the bar high!\n\nExcellent food, course sizes, drinks, and ambiance.\n\nService timing left a bit to be desired unfortunately. Our main course arrived quite a bit late in the performance, and dessert came afterwards. Then we were asked to leave to make room for the next reservation. It's understandable, yet did dampen the overall experience quite a bit.\n\nWould like to return again!",

We spent more than $80 per person for the three course meal and were very disappointed with our flavorless and underwhelming meal. The menu is trying to go for a sophisticated Caribbean flavor, but misses with cheap cuts of protein and incoherent pairings. If you are considering this as a dinner option, you’d be better off having dinner at one of Ann Arbor’a many other restaurants and then potentially having drinks only to enjoy the music. The service was adequate, but not what you would expect at this price point.\n\n(Photo is of the “sticky” rice - which was actually a soupy, flavorless mush)",

We bought one appetizer, one drink, and three dishes just to feel fed. So be prepared to buy appetizers, dinner, drinks, and dessert for the full experience.\n\nFor those with families, we brought our toddler, but it's more of a date-night vibe. They don't have any high chairs or changing tables.",

The atmosphere is really good, nice and relaxing. This isn't really an environment for conversations, the music is not background music, it's an experience. The food is artistically designed. Only down side is I wish the back seating was a booth setup so that my wife and I had a more intimate experience. Other than that, great place we'll be returning to.",
