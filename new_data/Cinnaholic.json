Therefore my review has relatively less credibility compared to that from someone who knows more about this category. I liked the texture of the roll and the well balanced cinnamon taste, but everything else was too sweat for me. I loved the first and maybe the second bite but could not really finish the whole. This does not necessarily mean their cinnamon rolls are wrong. They were just different from what I'm used to. But definitely worth trying!",

When taking the bus to work i always stopped in for a triple shot coffee every morning, the perfect push to get me through a shift. I’ve tried all of their floats, they have PINEAPPLE DOLE WHIP (the stuff from Disney world) and make incredible floats, that are perfect for nice weather, or just a tasty treat (they have great heating), onto their baked goods, you can taste the effort that goes into making every product perfect. Every cinnamon rolls i try is incredible, my favorites are the new seasonal apple fritter roll, a seasonal but not currently out,  peach cobbler roll, and anything with peanut butter on it. I recently had a seasonal peanut butter cookie, it absolutely blew me away, i tried to make my own version at home and came up short, so i will be returning shortly to buy them out. Their snickerdoodle cookies are incredible, don’t usually enjoy snickerdoodle cookies, but Cinnaholic’s are the best I’ve ever had. The atmosphere is enjoyable, and relaxed, the customer service is always incredible, and the owner always greets me with a smile when i see him. Such a amazing place, i refuse to go anywhere else for cinnamon rolls. Even if I’m out of town.",
