Bulgogi fries can be split with someone, at the half size. For $10 it was worth it, delicious, and satiating. Merch is available and they have a membership available. Pokebowl is a delicious option I would recommend. Bulgogi burrito is solid to split between two people.",

I stopped by for my first time on Sunday and had already ordered a few things online, but I was recommended to try a few other things but wasn't fully sure what I wanted. The guy at the front was very helpful, gave me recommendations and some small pours to taste a few different sours.\n\nIn all I went home with like $140 worth of beer and I am already tempted to put in another order to bring more back to the UP with me.\n\nSince then I always try to stop at HOMES when I can and am very excited that I can get Smooj in the Upper Peninsula now!\n\nGreat atmosphere with outdoor seating and covered outdoor seating, fire pits and heaters.\n\nThe Kimchi fries were very good, but the Bulgogi fries were even better!",

                "description": "Visiting family from out of town and they suggested I would like HOMES. Now I've been to a lot of breweries that have beer and food and undoubtedly, they only tend to get 1 out of 2 right. HOMES seems to have figured out how to have amazing food served quickly with a high quality bar AND pairing it with a delicious selection of beers.\n\nThe line to order looks deceptively long but everyone was quick, friendly and eager to help you get your grub (and drink) on! We had just about everything on the menu - the bulgogi fries and burrito were the stars. I was less impressed with the coconut ranch edamame and the brussel Caesar salad but they were still satisfying.\n\nI would be here every weekend if I lived in Ann Arbor!!",
