I ordered a 20 oz beer then received a 16 oz, soon to be replaced with my 20 oz.\nThen I ordered a Chinese “classic” from the menu which stated I would get crispy sesame beef and lemon chicken. No description other than that. I got soggy breaded beef slivers with a bunch of sauce to make it even more soggy. On the other side was breaded chicken and 2 slices of lemon. And 3 bits of raw broccoli??\nI expressed my disappointment to my server and she explained that I ordered spicy beef and that is not crispy. So I corrected her and told her I had double happiness and she said she’d “tell her boss”.\nNo discount on food or offer to do anything.  I don’t usually care but I really hated the food! AND she forgot the beer size and what I even ordered.",

Instead, I was greeted by a foul-smelling potato that was partially blackened - an unmistakable sign of rot. It’s beyond belief that a restaurant would serve food that’s not just below par, but downright spoiled. This goes beyond a mere culinary letdown; it’s a gross negligence of food safety standards. Patrons deserve better and should be wary of a kitchen that allows such oversights. Dine here at your own risk!",

The dish was delicious by the bone-in duck was chopped in a most unusual manner which made it very difficult to eat. I do prefer more authentic Chinese food to the Americanized versions so next time I order a new (to me) dish I will make sure to discuss the preparation with the server before ordering.",

                "description": "Probably the worst delivery food Ive ever eaten. We got pan fried noodles that looked like old ramen noodles someone left out along with vegetables floating in syrup. The “shanghai style pork buns” were dumplings in what tasted like maple syrup. The scallion pancakes were covered in grease. We got sick from the food. $85 for it all and we threw it in the trash.",
