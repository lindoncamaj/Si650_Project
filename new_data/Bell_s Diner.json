When you walk in you get the feel of a \"hole-in-the-wall\" diner, and the nice people of Bell's Diner will not disappoint you no matter what you order! The food is so delicious I can't put it into words. Plus, it's a nice quiet, comfortable atmosphere to enjoy your food. I ordered the veggie omelet and hash browns. Now I'm too full to move.

Our recent visit included someone having blueberry pancakes, another a breakfast sandwich on sourdough, and a third with beef bulgogi, which can be ordered as part of a stirfry with vegetables, or a sliced bulgogi option that is just slices of seasoned beef on a bed of white or brown rice and a side of kimchi.\n\nPlenty of parking on the side of the building, interior features homey decorations and an atmosphere that really brought me back to family restaurants from the last century. Start with mandoo dumplings and go from there.",

I think it’s unique they serve Korean food along with the standar American diner food you would expect. We didn’t order any Korean dishes, but will have to be back again to try those. My husband enjoyed the homemade biscuits and gravy. I loved my tuna melt, which was grilled to perfection with the best crispy crunch on the bread. The tuna salad was delicious and tasted homemade. Generous portions and attentive service!",

The diner is small, maybe less than 10 tables though 2 were for larger parties. High chairs are available (2). I ordered the beef ramen for “brunch”. It lacked flavour, beef and noodles were chewy, wasn’t very tasty. My family ordered regular breakfast and said it was good, though pricey for the amount and quality of food.\nA single toilet bathroom is located through the kitchen. Not enough space to walk through. We won’t revisit.",
