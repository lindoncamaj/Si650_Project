                "description": "UPDATE: I took back the ENTIRE DINNER today (08/09/2024) like I said I would. The lady working lied and FIRST said, \"Yeah, I know, because you got delivery not pick-up.\" How does that make any sense?\nUp next was, of course, \"You ate the food.\"\nFor her next attempt, she said SHE tried calling me. I pulled up my call history from last night, showed her, and said (very calmly), \"Nope, no missed calls.\" (Now SHE'S not calm.)\nTHEN she said she called Uber Eats and THEY called me TWICE. I asked her to show me where on my call log.\nTHEN, she when my driver showed up she had the driver call me twice...\nShe was SO caught up trying to prove me wrong, she didn't notice that I was filming (for my protection; she appears to be the type that will call the police when she don't get her own way), and you can see me BACK OUT of the \"establishment\" and point out to get the entr√©e INCLUDING the egg roll was returned to her, but my money was NOT returned to me.\n\nAfter an absolutely awful day,  I ordered delivery off Uber Eats and paid for \"Priority Delivery.\" I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp with Vegetables Dinner Combo and the Cranberry Swirl Cheesecake. My order arrived later than the time frame I paid for. Uber Eats said the order wasn't ready, so it was \"the restaurant's fault\" is what I was told. I received Turtle Cheesecake (See pix) which I can't eat bz I have a nut allergy, so I blessed my neighbor with the Cheesecake. Trying to end my day on a high note, I went to eat my dinner üçΩ and it was just SAD. It was mostly rice üçö, the vegetables were SLIMY and so chicken üêî wasn't appealing either. I'll be returning the dinner along with the egg roll and fortune cookie ü•† tomorrow. I DO NOT recommend.",
