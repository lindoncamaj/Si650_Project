                "description": "There’s no place like home!   We have been going to Bandito’s for 25 years!  I started out at KP’s location in downtown A2 and today we met my childhood friend (since we were 5!) and her husband and introduced them to Bandito’s!   We were pleasantly greeted by KP and chose our seating for lunch. Menus were brought out as we sat down and we ordered Frozen Strawberry Daquiris. They arrived quickly along with our waters. Food was ordered and as always, delivered quickly.  The restaurant was filling up as it was lunch time, but that didn’t stop the owner from waiting on all the tables along with Anjeet.   As I remembered, no disappointment at all - everyone’s dish was hot and delicious.  The chips were just as I remembered - delish!\nThe new location is better than the previous. Larger restaurant, beautifully designed with bright colors, bigger tables and larger booths. Great decision on the owners part for relocating - greater parking area and bonus not having to pay for parking either!\n\nIf you are looking for a great place to pop in for lunch or dinner - this is your place. You won’t be disappointed. Enjoy!!!",

                "description": "I stopped in for the first time and can't believe I've been missing out on this for so long. The food was very tasty and the prices are great, especially considering how big the portions are. I got the shredded beef burrito. It tasted great and was so big I couldn't even get through half of it. I wish I had taken a picture. Looking forward to coming back and trying some more items.",

                "description": "The enchiladas I had were actually very tasty.  We asked for chips and salsa before our meal, but unknowingly, there was a $6 charge for them.... And they weren't that tasty. Also the server we had was terrible... Not friendly or helpful at all.  When we had questions about ordering, we felt as if we were being challenged by the waiter. Plus, we ordered off the lunch menu and the prices were not that friendly, with the minimum price for a lunch special, was $10.  So although the entree was tasty, the rest of the problems killed it... I won't be back.",
