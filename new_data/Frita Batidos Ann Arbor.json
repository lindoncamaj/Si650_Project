Combination of all different regions with a Cuban flair. food is outrageous! if in the ann arbor / Detroit area this is a must visit. Friendly helpful staff, order at counter, they bring it out to you. Very knowledgeable about menu items. parking close is street parking 430-530pm best time to find it. May have to go to parking garage. either way worth it.",
