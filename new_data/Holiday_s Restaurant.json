Salad tomatoes were watery and nasty from being cut too long ago and stored next to onions in the refrigerator. Stuffing was liquid-y. Flat soda in the drinks. Gravy with clumpy bits that weren’t giblets. Cranberry sauce that had been sitting out. It’s too bad because the service was good, but we won’t be back.",
