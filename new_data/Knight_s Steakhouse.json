The salmon was just cooked to perfection, being charred and seasoned on the outside, but creamy all the way through. The side of mashed potatoes complemented the dish nicely.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is pretty nice too. More of a pub-like feel, and definitely not filled with your typical college student crowd. Prices range hover in the medium range ($20-$30 for a meal), but can really get up there.\n\nEnjoyed dining here!",

They were all really good, especially the soup and the steak! I will say I wasn’t as big a fan of the veggies that came with the steak, it felt a little plain and the home made chips were a bit too hard for my taste but overall we have such a great experience! The meat was cooked to perfection and the service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere was great as well!",

Had a reservation and was seated right away, in the middle of two aisle ways. Plenty of open tables, you would think this spot would have been a last sat section type of area, nope, right away place is wide open. People flying by both sides of us the whole time. Server was on point besides lying to us about the asparagus, said they were skinny like my pinky no bigger I said great I don't like it when they are as big as my thumb. He wasn't right though because what do we get, large asparagus one of which bigger than my thumb! This stuff was so hard you could only eat the top 3rd of it at most and not seasoned at all not even a hint of something. Ordered our bourbon butter hanger steak medium rare came out rare, the 5 slices there was. Had to get what sauce we could before it was a bloody mess. Steak came out all cut up also can't stand that. It should have been sent back right away and we didn't. Still can't believe this. I can do rare, wife can't so was trying to give her the more done outside bit. So I bought better looking asparagus at Kroger for 99 cents a bunch and I know how to season and marinade it I'll actually include a pic of that.. Expected for $34 theirs would be better... Yeah $34 for 5 slices of steak and 5 asparagus, ridiculous. Don't know where the Yukon gold potatoes were. The ceaser salads we ordered had practically no dressing on them. We got a bread basket about halfway through our stay, was a surprise and would have been nice if it was brought out like 30 minutes earlier... What a mess, server kept telling us he could have a manager come over and it's like no that's not what we want, if you can't handle it I'm not going to make a scene. And since he wasn't going to just bring something I did tell him while my wife was in the restroom that if he could bring us a dessert that would be real nice since it was our anniversary.. Oh and not sure why the table was covered in lint or dust but it was all over it that and salt. Can see in the one pics. Beast steak knives here and they do have Eagle Rare 10 year, $14 a hit though, kinda steep for something that's $37 a bottle and they don't have the right ice here either. No big round or square, so no old fashioned. Who wants an old fashioned with a bunch of little ice cubes.",
