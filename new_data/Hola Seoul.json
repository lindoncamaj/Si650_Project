They were probably the best corn dogs I’ve ever had. Light and crunchy, cheesy and delicious. I had one complaint and that was there was only 2 ketchup packets for the meal… and I’m not convinced that ketchup was even the right condiment. Would have LOVED a dipping sauce for the chicken and something more suiting for the corn dog.",
