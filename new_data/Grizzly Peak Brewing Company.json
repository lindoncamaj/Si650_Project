The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the garlic aioli sauce added just the right amount of tangy richness. Paired with their sweet potato fries, it made for a seriously satisfying meal.\n\nBut the experience doesnâ€™t stop at the food. If youâ€™re a beer lover, youâ€™ve got to try their beer flights. They offer a great variety, allowing you to sample different brews and find your favorite. Whether youâ€™re there for a quick bite or to unwind with some friends over drinks, Grizzly Peak Brewing Company has you covered!",

                "description": "Nice location. Great service! The Brewers Steak was good but steak was just 4oz. The Crispy Walleye was generous and good but a little greasy. The BBQ Ribs good amount very tasty, pull of bone. The Salmon sandwich was the king of the day! Very generous portion and will seasoned! The nachos were so so could have been or loaded. The seating could have had more umbrella. All in all good place. Price were good for the area. 2 glasses of wine+food for $35 per person.",

                "description": "Please bare with me.... I can't say enough about this place. We were in a very hairy situation trying to accommodate 15 hungry preadators on one of the wildest nights in Ann Arbor.  We just couldn't snare a spot.  But one call to Grizzly Peak, and they gave us no paws for concern about where to eat.  There is also a convenient parking lot right across the street. Atmosphere is family friendly (we had several hungry cubs with us, so that was a must!) Bench seating is available for 4, and tables can seat 9.\n\nI was surprised at how tasty the food was. I had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich & sweet potato fries. They both needed a few less minutes of fire..but were still delicious.\n\nThe batter in beer-battered fries was a bit overbearing. It was literally 70% batter & 30% fry.  No real substance to them, and its hard to tell where the batter ends and fry begins. Maybe steak fries would be a better filling.  Or, maybe combine onion rings and french fries somehow.\n\nI must admit i almost went into an uproar over the bill for 4 with 2 drinks was about $200 (incl tip) but the food is well worth it! Food was phenomenal. I apologize for any misspellings. Grizzly Peak just has beary good food!\n\nPlease poke the thumbs up if u like this review!",
