I didn't know this spot was here, but the people were nice. The art was super cool. Oh, I do have some pictures of the art ,ignore my forehead.\n\nAnyway, if you are in the area and want some good food from nice people, do it. I'm probably going to try the Yakisoba next and grab some of their Onigiri to try as well....or I might just get the Bibimbap AGAIN and try something else another time lol. We'll see, either way a photo of the food before I devour my carryout is in order. Thank you Korner Kitchen",

Unfortunately the sweet potato breading was rubbery and cold and it didn‚Äôt seem very fresh.   It‚Äôs a little thing but I asked for a side of eel sauce and it wasn‚Äôt included.\nI also ordered the Bi Bim Bop, my favorite Korean dish.   The meat and rice were tasty and perfectly done.    The veggies were fresh but bland.  The egg was way over cooked being so crunchy on the bottom you had to cut it with a sharp knife  and the yolk was hard not soft.   It was a huge disappointment.   Lastly I didn‚Äôt expect the whole thing to be drenched in hot sauce.   I expect the Kim-chi to be spicy but have never had this dish soaked in hot sauce.   Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt eat it because to me it was painfully spicy.    I asked for this over the phone so maybe it‚Äôs a misunderstanding and I now know to ask for zero hot sauce.\n\nThe red bean ice cream was generous and delicious.  I will be back for that.\n\nI hope this nice little restaurant can work out these bugs in good preparation.   I will try them again but go in and order personally to see if that helps.",
