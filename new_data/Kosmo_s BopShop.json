My favorite dish is Kosmo‚Äôs GoTo but sometimes I add different ingredients to it. There‚Äôs a nice variety of recipes he offers. You can also choose between white rice and brown which is super righteous. There‚Äôs nothing better than that and honestly I think Kosmo can cook with his eyes closed because he‚Äôs that good and does everything with pure ease.",

I‚Äôm Korean and found a couple of good Korean diners in AA, and this is one of them. What makes it authentic? The sauce. The addicting mixture of gochujang and sesame oil is exactly what I grew up with. If you want to try something quick, filling, and hearty, give this place a try.\nA tip: if you are doing a takeout, eat your bibimbob with a cup of warm, clear soup or hot/warm green tea. Adding some warmth helps enhancing the flavor.",
