                "description": "Efficient service and a very good hamburger. Their hamburger ordering system is good because they let you pick 3 items from a large selection of toppings without the price of the burger changing. They let you order it to your own doneness preference which is a big attraction to me because I like my burgers on the underdone side. I found my burger to be very very good. I'm significantly less impressed with their other items. In general I had been negative about the place for years, but consistently told I was wrong about it because it's a burger place and I should get the burger before judging it. The service ranges from excellent to impatient and a bit rude, but the place is often packed to the gills and they're always efficient so I can't knock them for the service. The hamburger there is indeed very very good. The atmosphere is pretty much just like a Midwest bar. In fact the whole restaurant is dominated by a bar that runs nearly the entire length of the restaurant. They also have TVs mounted in the corners of the room. Overall it's a pretty nice atmosphere, but it has often been uncomfortably crowded at peak times in the past.\n\nIf you want a great burger, go when they're not busy. It's still a fantastic burger when they're busy, but you may have to wait and you'll be eating it in a loud crowded place. If you don't want a hamburger, my advice is to skip it altogether. It's not bad. It's not in any way bad. But there is no reason to fight the crowds for the food unless you're really looking for a good big hamburger.",

You could put this place anywhere and it would be the best burger place. Seriously I was planning on eating healthy, but just the smell from parking walking to the building was like ok I am going to have to try the burger. Literally the best burger. The fries are not special, if they did fresh cut fries or even skin on frozen would be better. Nonetheless regardless of fries, the burger will be one of the best if not the best you’ll ever have. I would not even try anything else on the menu, if you get the chance to go there, you will not be disappointed in their burgers.",
