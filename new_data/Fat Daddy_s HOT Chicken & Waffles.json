                "description": "⭐\n\nA couple of years ago, we tried Fat Daddy's HOT Chicken & Waffles at another location in the state and had a great experience (5 stars), so we were excited to try their secondary location in downtown Ann Arbor. Unfortunately, we were completely disappointed on all levels.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted by a dirty, unkempt restaurant. The temperature inside was that of a hot, sweaty kitchen—clearly, the air conditioner wasn't working. One of my party members went to use the restroom and came back to inform the staff (who spoke zero English) that it needed extreme attention and had no toilet paper. The staff member simply shrugged and said, \"I don't know,\" and carried on.\n\nThe ordering process was confusing. We were greeted and asked if we needed help, but then directed to a kiosk to place our order. Despite being the only people in the restaurant and ordering very minimal items (a two-piece tender and one large smothered fries with chicken), it took 25 minutes to get our food.\n\nIf you're thinking about hot chicken, this is not the place. I chose the \"hottest\" (2nd to the last) option, and it was neither hot nor flavorful. One side was coated, while the other side was bare. We didn't finish our food and instead waited for the next chicken place down the road to open.\n\nWhile I wish this location the best of luck, the company seriously needs to step in and handle their quality control on every level. If they don't, they'll be in serious trouble, and this restaurant could come to a complete halt as their image slowly diminishes. I can't say I'll be back to this location ever, though I will go to their original location.",

First time was fine, food was good.\n\nTonight was a different experience, though I think the same 2 gentlemen were working.\n\nFood took 20 mins to make (with time stamps), in that time very little went out. The guy had to confirm 2x what I got after it was ordered, I suspect to prompt the cook to get going - definitely the 1st time after 10 minutes. The sauce they include is in a container my chicken tenders don't fit into, and was gone after the 12th fry.\n\nFood is okay, but there were 3 separate people asking how much longer. He told all 3 \"he's bagging it\" though it was mine being bagged, at the 20 minute mark.\n\nWill go again if I have the time to spare for a take out order of 2 tenders and fries to take 20 minutes.",

The portions were generous, the flavors were perfection (we ordered it hot--just enough to feel the heat, but not enough to break a sweat), the fries were seasoned and crisp. The Banana pudding made me weak in the knees. Seriously....run, don't walk to this place! We can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",

                "description": "This place was so fire, in more ways than one. Probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had in my life. The spice level was perfect, the portions were hefty, the coleslaw had an optimal amount of sweetness, and the prices were extremely reasonable. They also had some unique menu items that had me salivating. Would definitely return and bring more friends too.",
