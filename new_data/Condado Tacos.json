Smoked cheddar queso is great addition to the fresh chips only with the air conditioning will thicking up so eat soon. The cool ranch is okay but the ground beef taste a little lack luster, all the Brisket and steak options are definitely worth every bite, and I for sure will be making a return.",

The server also familiar with the menu which I also liked because It was my first time.\nAtmosphere: I enjoyed this the most, the wall art is beautiful from the bathroom to the whole building. I enjoyed the colorful dim lights on a Sunday night & I enjoyed how it wasn't busy. The menu is also really pretty as well.\nParking: Its Ann Arbor, either have to park in a garage & walk or a pay meter. Luckily on Sunday there is free parking.\nFood: All tacos have to be bought individually which can be pretty pricy. I only been here once, i tried 2 tacos. A Chicken Bacon Ranch taco, I didnâ€™t really like it because of the taste of the chicken and there was a lot of queso. I had a collard green taco or something close to that name with seasoned beef & I liked how that tasted but it gave spicy taco bell taco. I liked that the tacos were double wrapped. I also enjoyed the complementary chips, the taste of the chips was different for me, very similar to the corn taste which I enjoyed & the guac and red salsa were also good. The salsa was less spicy than the guacamole which Iâ€™m not a spicy fan but I love guac so I overcame.",

                "description": "Dined in for lunch. Not overly busy. Sat at the bar. The bar tender ignored my empty drink till after my meal was finished. Ordered 2 tacos and a side of rice. Tacos were good. Chicken taco had a watery juice in the bottom. Pork taco was tasty. The rice was very plain flavored and was luke warm. Food is served wrapped in foil and placed in a plastic basket. Plastic utensils as well. Street art stoner vibe to the murals that surround the place. Well stocked bar. Steel seats become uncomfortable after about a half hour of sitting.",

The taste ðŸ‘… isn't anything extraordinary, but it's definitely above average. Much more value than nearby Isalita, for example...",

                "description": "Amazing staff and food. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated. Creates a chill atmosphere, they have great drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). Their Cactus Juice mocktail was great, they also serve margaritas on a flight where you can choose any three flavors (pictured were mango, hibiscus, and strawberry). Higjly recommend hibiscus. The tacos were amazing I highly recommend (and pictured) the Cali Green for a sweeter (honey chipotle) ground beef taco, Dado Supreme was mild spice.",
