I especially like their omelettes (usually tender/not overcooked) and hash browns (not underdone and crisped on the outside and soft on the inside). I also enjoy the corned beef hash (comes w 2 eggs). Update: I have eaten in the restaurant 3 times with family.  They have friendly, very attentive servers and just good service all around. Kari/Carrie served us each time, and on the 3rd visit, she remembered everything extra we asked for the table on the last visits üòÅ!\nThe rest of the time I have done takeout. Prices are lower in person or if you call in your order versus order on DoorDash.\nIt is also nice that they are open Mondays.",
