Definitely in contrast to Ann Arbor’s trendy breakfast places.  Nothing fancy here, just good old American fare.  Food is good, portions are generous.  Not the cleanest restaurant I’ve been in.  Service was attentive.  I will eat here again.",

                "description": "I've wanted to try Franks for a while now. I door dashed the Franks famous French Toast, Western Omelet with cheese and a side of hash browns. The Omelet was perfect. It had lots of fillings, very cheesey, and a great sized portion. The hash browns were uninspiring unfortunately. I wished they were a little crispier and they need more salt.  Now, the French Toast was the star of the show. Crispy exterior with a light doughy center, it was cooked perfectly. It's easily the best french toast I've had in Ann Abor. It's definitely worth going back.",

They have excellent breakfast dishes, and if you see the Philly Cheesesteak on the lunch, you'd be greatly remiss not to order it. I've found their portions are very generous and the service incredibly efficient and polite. My secret tip? The delicious Greek lemon egg drop soup that is sometimes in the menu. And so. Very. Delicious.",

It is located right off the central U of M Campus - near Nickel's Arcade. We visited in August 2018 - and found the huge portions and low prices refreshing -- just about everything else in the area has become expensive and rather \"chic\" as Ann Arbor becomes more upscale. I remember Frank's back from my student days and nothing much has changed. It is a favorite hangout for the football team, we ended up sitting next to three players on the team who clearly were beefing up on the huge portions. Our bill for lunch for two including beverages, tax, and tip under $25.00.  Highly recommended, even if you do not have memories that date back college days.",
