Baked goods are fresh and delicious.  Eggs are overflowing in the breakfast biscuit.  Belgian waffles have tons of fresh fruit and are filling.  The \"small\" fruit cup is actually quite large and has great variety.  Frankly, only downside is that it takes forever to order and get your food during peak times.  Servers and staff are friendly and working hard, but they just seem a little under staffed.  Still definitely recommend, but be prepared to wait in line.","link": "https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaMk9mY0h3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1b4f20286dc8827f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICZ2OfcHw%7CCgwI69PTpwYQsNmPkwI%7C?hl=en-US","images": [{"thumbnail": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMObK05NxrvtAbHTVVKjhVQo6mfUmTdr-GBR8cW=w150-h150-k-no-p"},{"thumbnail": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsVRDusX5ZXMHBsARYuEWFiMkEe0k2QVxZWwfb=w150-h150-k-no-p"},{"thumbnail": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiekyDciT1NOQeXzFPu37nU_7RMULeKvtoteNK=w150-h150-k-no-p"}],"date": "a year ago"},{"username": "Carol Sutherland","rating": 5,"contributor_id": "110369597111054747271","description": "We catered food for brunch (June 2024) and it was fantastic!

Everyone in our party of 5 enjoyed their main entrees except for the blueberry muffin (very dry) and seafood just doesnt jive with an omelet!! Service was a tad bit slow but that gave us more time with friends. Do try their shakes but be warned of their size!!
